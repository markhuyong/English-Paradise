  need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

  come on! Think! The CEO will be here any minute.

  you tell us what's happening?

  financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We're there to
  show the government that we don't like the way that they're spending our
  tax dollars!

  B: It's an absolute outrage, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25
  billion dollars of taxpayers' money to the auto industry. These are
  companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

  A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help
  save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.

  B: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their
  job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making
  millions of dollars? And then, they have the nerve to fly to Washington
  in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And
  they're asking for money! That is just not right!

  perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.

  B: I don't know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets
  right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don't know if
  you're aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets
  recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few
  months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will
  impact the economy. There's just too much instability. I wouldn't feel
  comfortable investing in this climate.

  A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And
  anyway, I'm not talking about investing in the domestic market. There
  are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for
  example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have
  recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for
  consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.

  B: Come on, son, you're looking at this too naively, the Chinese market
  has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been
  devalued by almost a whole percentage point.

  A: Fine, then! If that's the way you feel, so be it. But you're losing
  out on a great opportunity here. I'm going to go hit up Mum for the
  cash.

  I don't think he's a good fit for our company.

  B: Okay... what makes you say that? I thought you were pleased with his
  overall performance. Didn't you just tell me last week how impressed you
  were with his attitude?

  he's really productive, but then other times... take last Tuesday for
  instance, he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting!

  B: Well, I'm sure he had a perfectly good reason...

  A: But that's not the only thing... you know, he really doesn't have the
  best work ethic, I'm constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he
  should be talking to clients.

  B: Yeah, but come on, Geoff, as if you don't check Facebook at work.
  Look, you hired this guy, we've invested a lot of time and money in his

* Advanced - Just In Time Strategy (E0047)

  A: I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing
  plan. As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch, and the
  global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost efficient
  ways of producing our goods. We don't want to have to be looking at
  redundancies. So, we've outlined a brief plan to implement the
  just-in-time philosophy.

  B: We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we
  want to reduce our lead time.

  C: Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really
  needs to be worked on.

  B: Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better
  overall efficiency.

  A: Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations
  closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the
  number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving
  the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery
  lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers,
  possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or
  working with a faster shipping company.

  C: I see& That makes sense.

  B: The second point is that we want to require supplier quality
  assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently
  have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore,
  they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be
  implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality
  of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something
  goes wrong.

  C: I'm with you on this one. Its essential that we reduce these errors;
  we've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

  A: Exactly. Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into
  action. First...(fade out)

  Sorry I Love You V (C0054)

  A: Honey, of course I forgive you! I love you so much! I've really
  missed you. I was wrong to get upset over nothing.

  B: I'm sorry I haven't called or anything, but right after you decided
  you wanted a break, I was called up north to put out some major forest
  fires! I was in the middle of nowhere, working day and night, trying to
  prevent the blaze from spreading! It was pretty intense.

  A: Oh, honey, I'm glad you're okay! But I have some exciting news... I
  think I'm pregnant!

  B: Really? Wow, that's amazing! This is great news! I've always wanted
  to be a father! We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning!

  C: We have your test results back and, indeed, you are pregnant. Let's
  see here... everything seems to be in order. Your approximate due date
  is October twenty-seventh two thousand and nine, so that means that the
  baby was conceived on February third, two thousand and nine.

  B: Are you sure? Are these things accurate?

  C: Well, yes sir, they are.

  A: What's wrong? Why are you asking these questions?

  B: This baby isn't mine! I was away the first week of February at a

  get this job!

  B: I know! It's an amazing growth opportunity! They're true industry
  leaders, and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization
  that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

  A: So, let's see, you did your research on the company, right?

  B: Well, I visited their website and read up on what they do. They're an
  IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for
  large corporations. They provide services such as CRM development, and
  they also offer customdesigned applications.

  A: So what would your role in the company?

  B: Well, the position is for an account manager. That basically means
  that I would be the link between our and our development team.

  A: Sounds good, and so, why do you want to work with them?

  B: Well, as I said they're the industry leaders, they have a really
  great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees,

  A: Thanks for coming in today, did you have any trouble finding us?
  Please take a seat.

  B: Thank you.

  A: So, let's get started; tell me a bit about your educational
  background.

  B: Sure! Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a
  major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information
  Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose this course of study
  for two reasons: I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills,
  which the information management track provided, and I also feel that
  interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the
  minor in psychology.

  A: Interesting. And, your postgraduate studies?

  B: Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a
  master's in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills
  current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related
  management and customer service.

  A: Very good. Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience. I
  see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

  B: Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a
  breadth of experience in both client care, and process management. I
  supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as
  implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.

  A: Interesting...

  B: Yes, in this position I was able to make some pretty significant
  contributions to the overall success of the company. With the different
  initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five
  percent, which had a direct impact on revenue.

  B: Wait! Doctor how is this possible? I haven't cheated on my boyfriend!

  C: I have something to confess... I'm sorry Veronica, I lied.

  B: Wait... what? What do you mean?

  C: I lied. You aren't even pregnant; there's no bun in the oven. I was
  just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself. Veronica
  I love you!

  B: What are you talking about!!! Who are you?

  C: It's me! Daniel, don't you remember me? From high school. I sat
  behind you every day in class! I used to go to every football game and
  watch you in the cheerleading squad!

  B: You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did you lie like that to my
  boyfriend?

  C: Because Veronica... It's not fair! I love you; I have since the first
  day we met! Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the
  picture and ruined everything! I went to med school and became a doctor
  for you! You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor! You will be
  mine now... one way or another...

* Elementary - The Office - Job Interview III (C0065)

  A: Very good. Now, I have a couple of final questions.

  B: I hope they're not too hard!

  A: Well, why should we hire you?

  B: I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a
  unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft
  skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer
  relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support
  department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent
  of our customers' problems. I decided that we needed better information
  and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a
  series of training sessions in coordination with our technical
  department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers'
  issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to
  this company.

  A: Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

  B: To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.
  Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to
  organize my time efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness
  recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It
  helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get
  organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better
  now.

  A: Great... Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this
  interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week
  we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a
  second interview with our CEO.

  B: Great, thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.

  B: And we're on the brink of soccer history today, as Ecuador and Brazil
  are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup!

  A: The ref calls the players for the kick off, and here we go! Ecuador
  quickly passes the ball to the midfield, but, ohhh, it's out of bounds.

  B: That will be a throw in for Brazil. Adriano has the ball and makes a
  long pass to Robinho, and the ref has called him offside.

  A: No question about it. He was offside by a mile! We have a goal kick
  for Ecuador. Edison Mendez heads it to Valenica, he shoots! Deflected by
  the defender and we have a corner kick.

  B: Delgado takes the corner. We have a foul! Oh no, Dida, the
  goalkeeper, has fouled the Ecuadorian player! He gets a yellow card and
  that will be a penalty kick!

  A: This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this
  match and become World Champions! He gets ready for the kick. He shoots!

  B: Horowitz, I beg to differ. Even in your most recent study, the
  investigative approach was flawed! You know as well as I do that the
  collection of data was not systematic, and there is a large margin of
  error. To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be
  misleading A: That is preposterous!

  B: You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest
  mysteries, and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong!

  eggs?

  B: Sure, Ill take mine, sunny side up.

  A: Eww, I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that! Ever since I
  was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

  B: You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years.
  It drove my mom crazy!

  A: You know what really drives me crazy? When I ask for soft boiled
  eggs, and they overcook them, so they come out hard boiled! How can you
  dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

  B: You're so picky sometimes.

  A: Here you go, honey, fried eggs.

* Elementary - The Weekend - International Workers Day (C0078)

  A: Alright everyone settle down. Let's get started. As you know, an
  important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis
  of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is
  necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings
  me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May
  first?

  B: Cinco de mayo?

  A: No, that's May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my
  Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers' Day.

  B: Do we get a day off from school then?

  A: No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but
  in other countries it is.

  B: Aww, man!

  A: In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with
  workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day.
  Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly,
  despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by
  April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.
  Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed,
  so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution
  stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work. And, on
  May First 1886, the resolution took effect.

  B: Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?

  A: Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886,
  police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works
  Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for
  the next day to protest the brutality.

  B: And then what happened?

  A: Well, as we say, the rest is history...

  it. I can't believe he was stalking you all these years. What a nut job!

  A: I know! Well... he said I'm not pregnant. I'm sorry if I got you all

  He's safe!

  less. Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.
  There's a new dishwasher, and a professional-grade gas range. Really, at

  A: I love it! But what are the payment terms?

  B: First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the 1st of

  B: The living room and dinning room are quite spacious as you can see,
  and down this hall, here's the master bedroom. It has a huge walk-in

  B: Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

  A: I'm sorry, sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked
  luggage, at twenty kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage. I
  will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

  B: What? Why! I am taking an intercontinental flight! I'm flying sixteen
  thousand kms! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags?
  That's absurd!

  A: I am sorry, sir, there's nothing I can do. You cannot board the
  flight with that large bag either. Carry-on bags must fit in the
  over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.

  B: Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket,
  but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an
  arm and a leg! So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of
  this.

  A: Let's see... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.

  B: Steven, I...

  A: Okay, run! I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica, I'm
  sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy
  for the Indian government.

  B: What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here?

  A: When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my
  hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my father was a
  renowned chemist. One day, he was approached by members of the CIA,
  claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his
  small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never
  saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and
  consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

  B: What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most
  importantly, why did you lie to me!

  A: I'm sorry, I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall
  in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I
  feel for you is real.

  C: Greetings earthlings. I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known
  only to a few.

  A: Why are you here? Where did you come from?

  C: We have been observing you for the last three thousand years. We have
  seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the
  Taj Mahal or masterpieces such as the Haffner symphony. Unfortunately,
  your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence. Your
  ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to
  save your planet from you.

  B: You think you have us figured out? What gives you the right to come
  and judge us? Who are you to play God with our fate?

  C: Silence human! It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years
  of pain and anguish among yourselves! Now you will pay the price!

  with the plan, Bob Copeland.

  B: Thank you, Rick. We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us
  today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each
  other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams
  are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.

  A: The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribeiro serves
  and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter, and...
  a very nice set by Chen!

  B: Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers
  anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the
  ball in! Great play.

  A: It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we
  have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over
  the net.

  B: Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, after a short

* Elementary - Global View - Big Bang Theory (C0094)

  A: What's up? You don't look too good.

  B: Yeah, my head hurts, that's all. I've been in physics class all day.
  It's killer!

  A: I liked physics. It's all math, really; arcs, curves, velocity, cool
  stuff.

  B: Yeah, yeah, but today's lesson was all about the creation of the
  universe.

  A: A physics class about the creation of the universe? That's some
  pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.

  B: It's all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it
  possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?
  That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African
  myths about turtles and stuff.

  A: Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that's required for the creation of
  matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that's
  what the math says.

  B: Math, shmath. What's the evidence?

  A: There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He's the guy who in the
  early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of
  matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.
  What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH!

  B: Anyway, it's just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories?
  Where's the scientific rigor in that?

  A: Dude, don't equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after
  withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn't you?

  talking about work and family, when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse
  run under his chair and he completely lost it! He started freaking out,

  City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening. Things are

* Elementary - Global View - Movie Review (C0099)

  A: Welcome back movie lovers to another ” Premier Movie Review”. My name
  is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite David
  Watson.

  B: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie ” Lion
  King”. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?

  A: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal
  greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite
  the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other
  countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well
  done, and the story was simply enchanting.

  B: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong,
  and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great,
  the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare
  to say, it was too predictable.

  A: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the
  kids! It's not a thriller!

  B: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense
  scenes For example when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of
  Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking
  it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully
  his. It's just too cliché.

  A: How can it be cliché? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured
  story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to
  corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

  B: You have always been so soft, Dave!

  A: Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.

  B: Anyway... That's all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk
  about &quot; How to lose a guy in 10 days&quot; I'm sure you'll love
  that one Dave!

  A: Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me

  A: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how
  old are you?

  B: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

* Elementary - Global View - Global Warming (C0102)

  A: And therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early
  21st century. Questions?

  B: Uh& yeah. In the lecture you said there's more evidence in the
  scientific record supporting global cooling?

  A: Well, yes, essentially, the historical record supports a theory of
  climate cycles. Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the
  planetary eco-system.

  B: If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the
  rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global
  average temperatures?

  A: But are global temperatures rising? If you look at the data from
  nineteen seventy-five you'll&

  B: You'll be misled. If you were serious, you would look at the record
  starting in the 1880s. Then you would see how dramatically the earths
  temperature has changed.

  A: Young lady, I beg to differ. Look, the point of the lecture was to
  emphasize that there is evidence for both sides, and I'm putting forth
  the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global
  cooling hypothesis. Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is
  being manipulated and scared into believing there's some kind of climate
  crisis; this scaremongering is done, quite simply, for political
  reasons.

  B: But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like
  carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate
  for politicians to discuss?

  A: Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely
  unnecessary initiatives.

  B: Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species and investing
  in renewable energy. At the very least, you have to concede that this
  debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil. Buying
  oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating
  ends.

  A: Why, I've never been so disrespected in all of my days. I'm a
  professor, a scientist and researcher of high regard.

  B: Yeah, and a duplicitous one at that. Everyone knows you're in the
  pocket of the oil lobby. Why should we trust your so-called findings
  more than tobacco institute studies which say smoking doesn't harm
  health? You're full of it.

  B: Yeah. I know.

  A: I want to know where this relationship is going. I'm in love with you
  and I need to know...

  B: You know, I think you're awesome.

  A: I'm awesome. Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it.

  B: Honey...

  A: Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing, alright, we've had our
  laughs, but I don't appreciate... maybe it's just time we...

  B: Baby, I love you so much.

  A: You do?

  B: I love you. And I think you're awesome.

  A: Oh, I love you too!

  B: Come on. Put the gun down.

  A: Oh baby, I'm so sorry.

* Elementary - The Weekend - Skiing (C0104)

  A: Welcome ski lovers of all ages! My name is Rick Fields and here with
  me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

  B: Thank you, Rick! What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado where
  the sun is shinning, and we've got twelve inches of fresh powder. It
  doesn't get much better than this.

  A: That's right, Bob, but today we have a special treat for our viewers.
  We're joined here by Ian Roussy, the four-time giant slalom champion.
  And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the
  basics of skiing! So, let's hit the slopes!

  C: Well, first off, let's get those boots on. You're going to want to
  make sure your boots fit snugly.

  That's right; now snap them into your bindings.

  And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your
  eyes. It's a bright day today,

  so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes. We don't
  want you hitting any of those moguls!

  A: Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it is
  a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

  C: Easy there, Rick! Well, let's head on over to the chairlift, and test
  your skills! All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so, Bob, why
  don't you do a few snow-plow turns. Gnarly run, Rick! Nice carving!
  You've got some mad skills! That was sick!

  A: You wanna see gnarley? Well, see that bump over there, I'm going to
  catch some major air.

  C: Butt plant!

  B: Ha ha ha! He lost his skis! Yard sale!!!

  A: Ahem, well. Thanks for joining us here today, I think that about does
  it. Bob, Ian, time for some après-ski?

  C: No way, man! We're off to grab some freshies!!!

* Elementary - The Office - Job Well Done (C0105)

  A: And so, that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next
  year. Thank you very much for your time.

  B: Hey, that was quite the Presentation! Honestly, I was completely
  blown away by your strategy outline. I've gotta say, Alex, you really
  wowed me today.

  A: Aw, come on; it was nothing. I'm just doing my job.

  B: No, I think you deserve some recognition here; I mean, if I look back
  on your previous Presentations, this is a huge improvement.

  A: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on
  PowerPoint.

  B: And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing
  strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my
  suggestions.

  A: Yeah, well, that was some good advice. You made some really good
  points.

  B: Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you did a great job.

* Elementary - Daily Life - Mobile Phone Plan (C0106)

  B: Yeah, I've just moved here, and I'd like to activate my cell phone,
  and I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan, or a monthly rate
  plan.

  A: I see. Well, can I have a look at your phone? Unfortunately, this
  phone can't be used in the US; it's not compatible with our 3G network.

  B: What? Really? I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

  A: Well, you're in luck! You see, if you sign up for our three-year
  plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

  B: Really? What's the catch?

  A: There's no catch! You just choose a plan, sign a three-year contract
  and, that's it! Actually, we're running a special promotion right now,
  and we're giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value
  forty dollar plan.

  B: So what does this plan include?

  A: Well, you get nine hundred anytime minutes, and you can also enjoy
  free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients, one thousand
  text messages per month, and unlimited evening and weekend minutes. Oh,
  and we also offer a rollover option.

  B: Wow, all this for forty dollars per month?

  A: That's right, plus the activation fee, the emergency services fee,
  the monthly service fee, oh, and any charges for extra minutes, and...

* Elementary- Daily Life Complain in gat a Restaurant (C0107)

  A: Excuse me, waiter? Waiter!

  B: Yes, sir? What can I do for you?

  A: I've been sitting here for the past twenty minutes and no one has
  offered me a glass of water, brought any bread to the table and our
  appetizers haven't been served yet! You know, in this kind of
  establishment, I'd expect much better service.

  B: I am sorry, sir. I'll check on your order right away.

  C: Relax honey, the place is busy tonight, but I've heard the food is
  amazing. Anyway...

  B: Here you are, sir. The foie gras for the lady, and a mushroom soup
  for you.

  A: Waiter, I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus. This soup
  is obviously too runny, and it's over-seasoned. It's completely
  inedible!

  B: Okay, I do apologize for that. Can I bring you another soup, or would
  you like to order something else?

  A: Take this foie gras back as well, it's rubbery and completely
  overcooked. And look at the portion size! How can you charge twenty-five
  dollars for a sliver of duck liver?

  B: Right away... sir.

  C: Honey come on! The foie gras was fine, why are you making such a big
  deal? Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

  A: What do you mean? We are paying for this. If I'm shelling out my hard
  earned bucks, I expect value for money!

  B: Here you are, sir. I hope it is alright now. The chef has prepared it
  specially for you.

  A: Yes, fine.

  C: Honey, are you alright?

* Elementary - The Office - Bad news, boss. (C0108)

  A: ... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous
  first quarter, Ed! Give us some good news. How are things looking for us
  in terms of sales this month?

  B: Uh well...would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

  A: What? Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news!

  B: Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the
  past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our
  profits are falling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way
  of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider
  redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations
  governing compensation packages. It's a real mess.

  A: For crying out loud... How fast are we losing money?

  B: Um...how can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, we will be
  filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months.

  A: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news?

  B: Oh, that's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems
  and, well, half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to
  recall all items sold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're
  going to have to shoulder this cost.

  A: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume
  the costs of this mess!

  B: We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner
  apparently has fled the country.

  A: We're doomed!

  B: There is some really good news though!

  A: Really? What!

  B: I got offered a new job!

* Elementary - The Weekend - Breaking Up (C0109)

  A: Honey, do you have a second?

  B: Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?

  A: We need to talk.

  B: Okay...

  A: I've been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other
  people.

  B: What? Why? I mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the
  occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

  A: That's just it, I'm not happy anymore, Tim. It's not you, it's me. I
  know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are
  the type of guy that any woman would kill for!

  B: So, what are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm
  perfect?

  A: Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you
  smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say
  that I'll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I'd only hurt
  you, I know I'd only make you cry.

  B: Baby, come on. Don't do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it
  out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this,
  but we gotta stick together! Don't leave me.

  A: I can't, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm
  only doing this for you. I don't really wanna go but, deep in my heart I
  know this is the kindest thing to do.

  B: Laura...

  A: Here are your keys. I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my
  things next week. I'm sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope
  that one day we can meet again. I'll always love you. Goodbye.

  A: Excuse me? Is this where I register? I'd like to sign up for my
  courses for next semester.

  B: Yes, of course. I need your student ID please.

  A: Here you are.

  B: Okay, Susan. It says here that you are a business major and you are
  in your second year. Is this information correct?

  A: Yes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a
  minor in psychology.

  B: Sure. That's not a problem. Do you have the list of courses you want
  to take this semester?

  A: Yeah. Here's my list. I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow
  me to take all of them though.

  B: Yeah, that's perfect. What about the subjects for your minor?

  A: Oh yeah! Almost forgot! I need to take fundamental linguistics,
  consumer psychology and neuroanatomy.

  B: Wow, you are going to be busy this semester! Okay, here you go. You
  are registered now; you'll have to make your first tuition payment
  before classes start.

* Elementary - The Weekend - Golf (C0111)

  A: Good morning golf aficionados! My name is Rick Fields, and you
  guessed it, I am here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

  B: Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies and gentleman, we are here in
  beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to
  win the grand prize of one million dollars!

  A: Whoa, that's a lot of cash! Let's go to the course and see how Tiger
  Woods is doing.

  B: All right, were're here at the eighth hole. It's a par four, and has
  some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.
  Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same
  hole!

  A: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let's see if he has the same
  luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to
  be very nervous.

  B: Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It's definitely not his day today. On
  the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He
  will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

  A: It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is
  having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to
  try and spot it.

  B: Oh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, run! Somebody call animal control!

* Elementary - Daily Life - Dr. Plumber (C0112)

  A: Good afternoon! Did you call for a plumber?

  B: Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I'm so glad you came! This old house
  is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there's water
  leaking everywhere!

  A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and
  that's why it won't flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that's not
  working either. I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in
  the pipes that's causing a blockage. That's what's making your toilet
  overflow.

  B: Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always
  flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.

  A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are
  really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing
  water to not drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the
  future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off
  properly. I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

  B: That would be great! Is it expensive?

  A: Let's see... I would say about eight hundred dollars.

  B: What? That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon!

* Elementary - The Office - Sorry I'm Late (C0113)

  A: Where is everyone? We were supposed to start fifteen minutes ago!

  B: Jo called and said she'd be here in a sec. She said she got tied up
  with a client.

  C: Sorry I'm late everyone. There was a huge traffic jam on the highway
  this morning.

  D: Morning everyone! Were you stuck in traffic as well, Jess? There was
  a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.

  B: Scott just called and said that he's running late. His last meeting
  ran over, but he's on his way now.

  A: Guys, this is not acceptable. If I say the meeting starts at ten, the
  meeting starts at ten. Not tenoh-one! And definitely not ten-ten! All
  right. Let's get started. So the first thing I want to talk about is
  our...

  E: I'm really sorry, everyone! I know I'm late. But really, it's not my
  fault. I was getting a coffee at Starbucks, and the line was way too
  long. I was waiting for twenty minutes to get my coffee!

  A: Don't be a airhead! This is a nineteen sixty-nine Chevy Impala! I
  just need to fix it up a bit. In a couple of months, this baby is gonna
  be wicked!

  B: Not even! Check it out! Now that's a fresh ride!

  A: Too bad the driver is a major dweeb. Anyone can have a car like that
  if their daddy is loaded like his.

  B: He's coming this way, be cool.

  C: Hey guys! What do you think of my automobile? Isn't it bad to the
  bone?

  A: Word! The ladies are gonna be lining up to get with you when they see
  you driving around in that car.

  C: You really think so?

  B: For sure!

  C: Awesome!

  A: Psych! haha.. you totally fell for it.

  queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

  A: Are you okay, man? You don't look very well.

  B: Ugh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with Trevor and things
  got a little out of hand.

  A: Nice! So, where did you guys go?

  B: We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends.
  Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was
  his birthday yesterday!

  A: Oh no! Mike's birthday is a drinkfest for sure!

  B: Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar!

  A: Is that why you missed work today?

  B: Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like
  five times.

  A: Eww!

  B: I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water, and my head
  has been pounding all day. I swear, I'm never gonna drink again!

  A: Too bad man, tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you
  were gonna go.

  B: Oh, yeah. I'm there!

* Elementary-The Office-You Missed The Deadline! (C0116)

  A: And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are
  with this project. As you know, you've missed a fairly significant
  deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team's ability
  to move forward with the next stages of this project.

  B: I know, I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it
  wasn't my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical
  problems at the last minute, and that I couldn't get into the database
  and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis.
  You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM
  stable, then I wouldn't have missed my deadline.

  A: Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You're
  essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues,
  rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were
  procrastinating for the past two weeks.

  B: No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who
  is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I
  could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down. And you
  know, with everything I've got going on now, I can't afford to waste
  time dealing with technical problems. I've got a lot on my plate and
  there are only twenty-four hours in a day...

  A: I'm not going to accept this excuse. You're using these small
  technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that
  you've missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to
  live up to those standards. No more phoney excuses. If you're in over
  your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data
  on my desk by nine am!

  Steven: Veronica. It's me, the man that has and always will love you.
  I'm sorry that I've lied to you. Believe me, it's been so hard for me as
  well, and time and again, I've thought of coming clean. But, I couldn't
  put you, or my mission at risk. It's all over now. My assignment is
  complete and now I have to go back to India.

  Veronica: What? Are you kidding? Is there anything else I should know
  before I never see you again? How could you deceive me like that?

  Steven: Yes... Veronica... I know that this isn't the best time and that
  you probably hate me right now but, I want to be completely forthright
  with you. I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has
  ever happened to me. Veronica... will you marry me? Come with me to
  India baby, I can't make up for everything that's happened, but I can
  promise you my undying love. I will be the most devoted husband, and I
  will cherish you always.

  Veronica: Steven... I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat!
  With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you any
  more. I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies. I do
  love you but... I can't go with you. I'm sorry... I love you...

  AIRPORT: This is the last call for flight eight one five from Los
  Angeles to Hyderabad.

  A: Good evening, my fellow Americans. Three days from now, after a
  half-century of service of our country, I shall lay down the
  responsibilities of office as, in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the
  authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This evening I
  come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a
  few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

  A: Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will
  labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be blessed
  with peace and prosperity for all.

  A: Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential
  agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which
  will better shape the future of our great nation. My own relations with
  Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of
  the Senate appointed me to West Point. I then had the pleasure of
  building more intimate relationship with Congress during the war and
  immediate post-war period. Finally, we have progressed to the mutually
  interdependent relationship we've had during these past eight years.

  oasis. There is one catch, though. We've only got one day to finish
  this, so I'm gonna need everyone to give one hundred and ten percent
  today. It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here, and I
  know that together we can tackle this project. That being said, let's
  get to work!

  B: That's right. Now, remember, we've been over the plans, but we really
  need to make sure that everything is up to code. The home inspectors
  here are pretty thorough, so please make sure you follow the plans
  exactly. And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb: measure twice and
  cut once.

  A: Okay, guys. Let's get at it. Bob! Pass me that hammer! The nails
  won't go in; the wood is too hard. I think I'm gonna need the nail gun.
  That did it!

  C: Do me a favor and help me cut this two-by-four, will ya? Pass me the
  circular saw, and grab hold of the end of the board. Now help me drill
  some holes in it so we can place the bolts.

  B: I think you should sand the edges. Look at all these splinters,
  someone could get hurt. Geez...you gotta take pride in your work!

  C: Yeah, you're right. Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

  A: Julia! Get over here with the level, measuring tape and that box of
  screws!

  C: Oh, no! Look out below!

* Elementary - Daily Life - No Smoking! (C0125)

  A: It smells like an ashtray in here!

  B: Hi honey! What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?

  A: What's wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking.

  B: No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't
  just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!

  A: Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch,
  or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month
  and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public
  place. It's not like you can just light up like before.

  B: I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just
  quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the
  morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?

  A: Fine! I want a divorce!

  Gulam: Steven! Good to see you brother! How are you? How was your trip?

  Steven: It was fine. I've been better but, it's great to be home, I've
  missed you all! How's mom?

  Gulam: She's great! All she ever does is talk about you -her little boy
  that went to the United States. You're her pride and joy, you know that?

  Steven: Can't wait to see her. And you? What's new with you?

  Gulam: Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You'll have another nephew or
  niece soon!

  Steven: That's great! Wow! Congrats! You two are great together, ya
  know. You have such a beautiful family. I hope one day I can have that.

  Gulam: Of course, man! Come on! I mean, everything was set here for you
  to marry Shalini! You know, she's still pining after you. I don't think
  she'll ever get over you. Steven: What are you talking about? I hardly
  knew her! How could she be in love with me? I couldn't go through with
  it even though she is a great woman. No, I left my heart in the United
  States. I just hope Veronica is happy.

  Gulam: Get over it! You're home now. Everyone here thinks so highly of
  you; there'll be girls throwing themselves at you. You can marry anyone
  you want!

  Steven: I don't want to marry anyone! I want to marry her! Don't you
  understand?

  Gulam: You are incorrigible.

  Liliana: Steven! My baby how are you! I've missed you so much!

  Steven: Hey, mom! Great to see you!

  Liliana: You look so thin! Didn't those Americans feed you? Come come,
  let's have some chai. By the way... There is a girl here waiting for
  you.

  Veronica: Hi Steven.

  Steven: Veronica! How did you get here? How did you know where I live? I
  waited for you at the airport but you never showed...

  Veronica: I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about,
  but we can discuss that later. I realized that I was just scared. Scared
  of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires. I'm
  here now. Now there is something I wanna ask you. Steven, will you marry
  me?

  Priest: I now declare you, husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.

* Elementary- Global View - Presidential Speech II (C0129)

  A: We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has
  witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved
  our own country. Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is
  today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in
  the world. We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we
  realize that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon
  our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on
  how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human
  betterment.

  A: Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic
  purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human
  achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among peoples
  and among nations.

  A: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have
  their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity
  shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may
  experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will
  understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are
  insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges
  of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the
  earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live
  together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect
  and love.

  A: Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen. I am proud to
  do so. I look forward to it. Thank you, and good night.

* Elementary - Daily Life - Going To The Gym (C0130)

  A: Hey there, you look a little lost. Are you new here?

  B: Yeah how'd you know?

  A: You can always spot the newbies. I can give you a few pointers if you
  want. Were you trying to use this machine here?

  B: Yeah! I just started my training today and I'm not really sure where
  to begin.

  A: It's ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper
  body, mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop
  strength or muscle tone and definition?

  B: Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique
  with weights and cardio.

  A: In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by
  working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be
  enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or
  you might pull a muscle.

  B: Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that's a
  lot of weight!

  A: It's not that much. Just watch... I'm ok...

  A: Okay, next question. If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you
  say?

  B: Duh! I would say yes! Eric is the most popular kid in school! Okay,
  my turn. What would you do if you won the lottery?

  A: Let's see.... If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a
  trip around the world.

  B: If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!

  A: My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!

  B: Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her
  you are going to get married?

  A: If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed!

* Elementary - Daily Life - Mechanic (C0132)

  A: Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem?

  B: I don't know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it
  just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here.
  What do you think it is?

  A: Not sure yet. How about you pop the hood and we can take a look.
  Hmmm, it doesn't look good.

  B: What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last
  month. It's brand new!

  A: Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator.
  You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your
  transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over
  here when your car died.

  B: Ugh... So how long is this going to take? An hour?

  A: I'm afraid a bit more than that. We need to order the spare parts,
  take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it
  back together again. You are going to have to leave it here for at least
  two weeks.

  B: What! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping? This is not
  happening!

* Elementary - Daily Life - Doing Laundry (C0133)

  A: Ok, let's go through this one more time. I don't want anymore ruined
  or dyed blouses!

  B: I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites
  and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing
  machine.

  A: Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type
  of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a
  shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this
  detergent when washing.

  B: So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it
  out?

  A: Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of
  bleach on it and it will do the trick.

  B: Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and
  its all set right?

  A: No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the
  dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.

  B: You know what? I'll just have everything dry cleaned.

* Elementary - Daily Life - Buying a TV (C0134)

  A: Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.

  B: Honey I told you already. I can't appreciate the graphics level and
  detail of the games on my Playstation 3 on our old TV.

  C: Good afternoon folks! How can I be of service today?

  B: I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.

  C: You've come to the right place! What size are you looking for?

  A: Just a normal sized TV for our living room.

  C: I see. Well this set here is on sale. It's a forty six inch HDTV
  screen and has all the works. Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S -
  Video ports. It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or
  laptop! This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience!

  B: This is exactly what I need! Can you imagine watching movies or
  playing video games on this thing?

  A: Honey, I think it's a bit too big. I don't even think it will fit in
  our living room.

  C: Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home. It comes
  with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture!

  B: This is great! How much will this set me back?

  C: Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half
  off!

  B: I'll take it!

* Elementary - Daily Life - Cheer Up (C0135)

  A: Ok... I'll talk to you later. Bye B: Carrie, are you ok? You seem a
  bit down.

  A: I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting
  upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at
  times.

  B: Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He
  does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.

  A: Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out
  what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always
  shuts down and brushes me off.

  B: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge
  and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through
  aggressiveness.

  A: I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't
  always this grouchy you know...

  B: Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't
  work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!

  A: You are something else you know that?

* Elementary - Global View - Gambling (C0136)

  A: Did you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our
  city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will
  be good for our business!

  B: Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and
  fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole
  purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me.

  A: What are you talking about? How does it exploit people?

  B: Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys
  families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very
  difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out
  on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men
  become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk.
  Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the
  social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports
  with friends and then illegal bookies.

  A: Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn't such
  a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn't become
  addicted or anything like that.

  B: You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse
  me, I have a protest rally to organize!

* Elementary - Daily Life - Getting Internet Service (C0137)

  A: Welcome to Galanet. How can I help you?

  B: Hi. I would like to get an internet plan for my house.

  A: Of course. We have three different plans with different prices you
  can choose from. The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which
  is thirty dollars a month. This is for broadband internet with a
  download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps.

  B: I have no idea what kbps means. I just want to be able to get online,
  play games and chat with my friends. Oh, and watch movies online as
  well.

  A: Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs. I
  suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which
  includes a connection speed of two megabytes. That way you can play
  games online without any lag. This package also includes a wireless
  router and a personal firewall absolutely free!

  B: Do I have to pay an installation fee?

  A: Lucky for you, this month we aren't charging our normal installation
  fee. You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there! And we'll throw in
  this pen drive!

  B: Awesome!

  Fox.

  Agent: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

  Man: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my
  reservation?

  Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

  Man: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the
  reservation.

  Agent: I know why we have reservations.

  Man: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how
  to take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation
  and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the
  holding. Anybody can just take them.

  Agent: But we do have a compact or an SUV if you'd like.

  Man: Fine. I'll take the compact.

  Agent: Alright. We have a blue Ford Focus for you Mr. Fox. Would you
  like insurance?

  Man: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the

  Daddy: Bobby! Come here, look what I got you!

  Bobby: What is that?

  Daddy: A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!

  Bobby: Cool!

  Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and
  I'll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns.
  Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward.
  When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space
  diagonally.

  Bobby: What about all these other pieces?

  Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook. The
  one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This
  is called the knight, it's a very important piece so it's best to not
  let your opponent capture it.

  Bobby: And these two? They are husband and wife?

  Daddy: That's right! That's the queen and that's the king. If the other
  player captures your king, he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is
  over! Doesn't this sound fun?

  Bobby: Nah! This is boring! I'm gonna go play Killer Zombies on my
  PlayStation!

  running slow. There really isn't much I can do.

  Customer: What do you mean? I bought this computer just three years ago!

  Sales Clerk: Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is
  becoming obsolete faster and faster!

  Customer: Ok, I know where this is going. How much will it cost me to
  get a new computer?

  Sales Clerk: Well, this desktop over here is our latest model. It has a
  four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk
  with one terabyte. Of course, it includes a mouse, keyboard and desk
  speakers.

  Customer: I have no idea what you are talking about. I just want to know
  if it's good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the
  computer crashing or freezing all the time!

  Sales Clerk: This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never

  A: This is the good life! We have it good don't you think?

  B: Yeah of course! Although, don't you ever wonder what ”could have
  been”?

  A: What do you mean?

  B: Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had
  done things a little differently.

  A: For example?

  B: Like for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have
  become an artist like I wanted to.

  A: I see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if
  I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

  B: You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met
  if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!

  sec? I need your help.

  A: What is it? Why are all these clothes on the bed?

  B: I don't know what to wear! Ok, give me your opinion. Do you like the
  way this looks? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered
  sweater and my lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts
  so I think I'll wear these as well.

  A: Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a
  dinner party not the beach! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought
  you and these corduroy pants. It's chilly outside so you can wear this
  coat.

  B: Thanks honey! You have such great fashion sense. Now, what am I going

  mean.

  Gina: Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of
  boneless chicken breasts?

  Butcher: No, no no no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some
  nice chicken thighs.

  Gina: No, that won't do. I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

  Butcher: Okay, is there anything else?

  Gina: Do you have any other cold cuts? Is this salami and bologna you
  have here?

  Butcher: Yes! It's very fine meat! Made it myself...

  Gina: Sounds good. Okay, that's it.

  Butcher: Wait! We have T-bone, rib eye, and sirloin steaks. They are
  very fresh! Just came from the slaughter house...

* Elementary - Global View - Capital Punishment (C0144)

  ProfeTsshoar: It's all for today's class. We will continue our lecture
  on crime and punishment tomorrow.

  A: Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

  B: Well, it depends on what you mean.

  A: For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give
  longer prison sentences for lesser offences and lock up juvenile
  offenders.

  B: Those really sound like Draconian measures. Firstly, what do you do
  about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to
  death?

  A: You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that
  you'd convicted the right person.

  B: But, there've been many cases of wrongful conviction where people
  have been imprisoned for many years. The authorities were sure at the
  time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable. In some
  cases, it'd been fabricated by the police.

  A: Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good
  case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

  B: I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the
  detection rate is so low. The best way to prevent crime is to convince
  people who commit it that they're going to be caught. It doesn't make
  sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

  A: But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons. In my
  reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn
  that they couldn't get away with it. Soft sentences will merely
  encourage them to do it again.

  B: Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals. To
  remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

  A: Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and
  punishment. I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment,
  not consciousness of doing the right thing.

  B: You sound like a dictator!

  A: Well if it works, why not?

  B: I feel itchy! I can't stand it anymore! I think I may be coming down
  with something. I feel lightheaded and weak.

  A: Let me have a look. Whoa! Get away from me!

  B: What's wrong?

  A: I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious! Get away! Don't
  breathe on me!

  B: Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy! We can't be sure until I see a
  doctor.

  A: Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn't get it when I was
  a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!

  B: Are you serious? You always blow things out of proportion. In any
  case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

* Elementary - Global View - Animal Rights (C0146)

  A: You should have seen the T.V. show that was on last night, the topic
  it covered was really interesting; animal rights.

  B: Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on
  something, they should do it on civil rights.

  A: Yes, but we cant deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and
  are completely at the mercy of human beings.

  B: I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions
  against human rights. If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic
  of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being
  instead of protecting a koala.

  A: You cant compare apples and oranges; I believe that both topics are
  important and that we cant ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can
  cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should
  prohibit activities like poaching.

  B: Well, you are right on that point. This is the reason that I dont buy
  leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

  B: At least youre doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in
  the house that I treat like a member of the family.

  A: As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, its fine.

  it's so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life,
  so much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

  B: I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice
  evening, but you're always so negative.

  A: I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought
  and then thrown in the garbage.

  B: You see, that's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic
  jokes anymore A: Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch
  with his feelings.

  B: Well he's more of a man than you are; at least he appreciates love
  stories.

  A: Love? More like one-night-stands.

  B: Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends
  of yours; they're no saints.

  A: My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?

  B: You're unbearable; you can walk home, I'm leaving.

  B: What's the matter with you? Why are you acting all paranoid?

  A: Paranoid? I'm not paranoid! I'm cautious! You see Dan, we have to be

  around here. I'm gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a
  while.

* Advanced - Darwin's Theory Of Evolution (E0151)

  A: It's been a long time since I last saw you. Where have you been?

  B: The exams and plans I have to turn in are driving me crazy, I don't
  even have time to sleep.

  A: It's the same for me. I'm up to my neck in work, but at least finals
  are coming soon and we'll have a vacation. Where are you going now?

  B: I'm going to Anthropology class and now with the year anniversary of
  Darwin, it's the only thing we study. Frankly, I'm sick and tired and
  tired of hearing about this guy.

  A: What? Why? How can you not like Darwin? I mean the man changed the
  entire perception of how things came to and his theory is backed by
  pretty solid evidence!

  B: I don't like him. His theory of human evolution and natural selection
  is full of holes. It lacks the solid evidence of which you speak of.

  A: That statement puts you at odds with half of the academy. Not to
  mention your professors! Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin
  about the origin of species and the mechanism of natural selection
  constitutes a grand step toward a coherent understanding of the world
  and evolutionist ideas.

  B: I'm not minimizing his grand contributions, it's just that his theory
  reminds of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.

  A: What are you talking about?

  B: The question is, which was first? The chicken or the egg? I feel the
  same regarding his theory. How does the first cell of life come to be?

  A: Interesting. I think that question is better suited for my philosophy
  class. In the meantime, how about we settle this... with a due!

  Mary: Fine! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every
  time you have a cup!

  Ed: I don't slurp my coffee. And plus, how can you hear it when you're
  shouting into your phone all the time?

  Mary: You've got to be kidding me! You're complaining about me talking
  on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to
  shoot the breeze?

  Ed: Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these
  conditions, and it's probably okay to let off steam once in a while But,
  it's probably not a good idea to keep it up I'm willing to forgive and
  forget and if you are.

  Mary: Fine. Let's call a truce. I'll try to more considerate and to keep
  the noise down Ed: Yeah, I'll try to do the same. So, I was wondering
  you wanna go out to dinner Friday night?

  ok?

  Tom: I don't know. I didn't really feel like going out. I guess I'm
  feeling a little homesick.

  Sarah: Come on We've been through this already! Look, I know the
  adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were
  gonna try and deal with it.

  Tom: I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be
  able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for
  some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my
  family.

  Sarah: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first
  got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me
  of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out,
  keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to it.

  Tom: I see what you mean, but I 'm still bummed out.

  Sarah: Ok how does this sound: let's get you suited up and hit the dance
  club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a
  lot of pretty single girls there!

  Tom: You know, I could really go for that. You don't mind being my
  wingman for tonight?

  Sarah: Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys night out... well
  kinda...

  I'll tell you a scary story! It happened to me and my dad when I was a
  teenager... ( fade out - fade in new scene) I was living with my father
  at the time, when he received a phone call.

  B: Hmm... I know! I'll tell you a scary story! It happened to me and my
  dad when I was a teenager...I was living with my father at the time,
  when he received a phone call. I was living with my father at the time,
  when he received a phone call.

  FatheHr:ello? Yes this is him. I see, I'm sorry to hear that. Ok no
  problem. I'll be there shortly. Pack some clothes Tony, my great aunt is
  very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her. We are
  going to stay at her house for a few days.

  Kid: Aunt? What aunt? I never knew you had a great aunt!

  FatheWr:ell, the family doesn't talk about her or get near her, for that
  matter.

  Kid: Why is that?

  FatheCr:ome on, we have to go.

  B: So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of our town. There
  was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it. Once
  inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my
  dad's great aunt in a wheelchair, yelling at someone, but we were alone
  in the room.

  FatheHr:i, aunt Ursula! This is my son Tony.

  UrsulWa:hy have you come? Why are you here? Don't you know it isn't
  safe? My time is near, he is coming for me.

  Kid: Who is coming for you?

  UrsulTah: e prince of darkness! The lord of the underworld, the tempter,
  the old serpent.

  FatheCr:ome on, aunt Ursula let's lay you down. You need to get some
  rest. Tony, help me lay her down.

  B: That night, we slept in one of the 12 rooms of that big old mansion.
  The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed ghoulish
  shapes on my bed. All of a sudden, we heard screaming.

  UrsulAah: hh! Get off me beast! I won't let you take me! Ahhh!

  Kid: Dad! Dad! Something is attacking aunt Ursula! UrsulUa:rsula: Take
  your claws off me! Go back to the underworld you demon! I shall be
  judged before you can take me!

  FatheTrh: e door is jammed! Stand back! Aunt Ursula! Where are you?

  Kid: Over here!

  B: And as we approached her, she was lying on the floor, with her hands
  and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody
  marks and scratches on her arms, legs and face. Remember how I mentioned
  that she was in a wheel chair? My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck
  down for just over a year. After this incident, strange things would
  happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her,
  warding off the evil that had come to get her. As the days passed, she
  became very weak and eventually was unable to talk. My dad had to work
  during the day, so I was left to care for her. When she lost her voice
  and laid on her death bed, I would hear her breathe, in and out.

  B: Until finally one day, she breathed in... and never exhaled. That
  night, I felt relieved that it was finally over, but it wasn't.

  B: I was so terrified of what I was hearing, that I didn't sleep all
  night. The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find
  a mess and everything torn up, but I found everything exactly as it was
  before. The movers came that same day and as we were cleaning out her
  drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and
  amounts of money written next to them. We found pictures with people's
  faces sewn with black or red string. And you want to know what the
  strangest thing was? There was a small doll, filled with dead ants, with
  a strand of hair tied around it's waist, and on the doll's face, there
  was a picture of me with the numbers: ”311009”. You know what date it is
  today? October 31st, 2009....

  He's in a bit of a jam.

  A: Why? What happened?

  B: Well, his son had an accident and Bill doesn't have health insurance.
  This really got me thinking, and I wondered if we shouldn't look into a
  couple of different HMO's.

  A: Yeah, you're right. We aren't getting any younger and our kids are
  getting older.

  B: Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO's with low
  co pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too.

  A: Sounds good, although, do you think we can qualify for insurance?
  Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money.

  B: Well, we don't have any pre existing illnesses or conditions, so we
  should be fine.

  A: I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare.

  awesome. It's a multi player game where you can go online and compete

* Elementary - Global View - Social Security (C0163)

  A: Well that was an interesting documentary!

  B: For sure! I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon
  they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.

  A: Like what?

  B: Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a
  401K?

  A: Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan
  that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement
  Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of
  money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan Everyone tries to
  contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest
  peacefully on your nest egg.

  B: That's interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have
  to contribute to a government run retirement fund, but most people don't
  really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.

  A: That seems a bit unstable don't you think?

  B: Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among
  banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money
  hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

  A: I've been thinking of doing that lately! I don't want some banker to
  run off with my money!

* Elementary - Daily Life - Apology Letter (C0164)

  A: Dear Mary, I come here today, in this way, because I need to
  apologize to you. I failed you. Although I did not lie to you in words,
  I lied to you with faces that did not belong to me. I never meant to
  ruin the friendship that meant the world to me. You mean the world to me
  and now I come to you asking for forgiveness. If in your heart you find
  you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.

  A: You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most. We talked
  about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul
  could actually feel something other than hurt. You placed comfort where
  there was fear, confidence where there was doubt, a shoulder where tears
  could fall and completeness where there was emptiness. I wanted to hold
  onto to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice.
  What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who
  I was and all that I had placed in you.

  A: I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk. I
  wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to
  handle. I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed
  impossible. I wanted to love you in only the way you deserved to be
  loved, never realizing that I was destroying myself and you. Somehow I
  needed you to be a part of my life. The only problem was that I was
  willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.

  A: All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me
  feel were true. Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter
  in your voice when you were happy. You made my days easy to get through
  and my nights peaceful; you helped me look forward to another day. Even
  though distance separated us, just being was enough.

  A: I'm sorry for hurting you and if I had to do all over again I would
  have been 100% with you. Forgive me please,

* Elementary - Daily Life - Asking For A Loan (C0165)

  B: Hello Sir may I help you?

  A: Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.

  B: Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride
  ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal
  loans.

  A: I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let's say, ten
  thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?

  B: It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten
  thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty
  eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan
  which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual
  interest rate. This of course is considering that you don't default on a
  payment!

  A: It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible
  credit score.

  B: That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your
  personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant
  information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.

  A: You know what? I don't really need the money. Thanks anyways!

  or tummy tucks look weird. It doesn't look natural.

  B: Whatever, I think I'm gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some
  breast implants as well.

  A: I think you need to get brain surgery. I honestly don't think you
  need cosmetic surgery You look amazing.

  B: I thought you were my friend and would support me on this! I just
  want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

  A: You don't need plastic surgery to do that. You are fine the way you
  are and you have guys drooling all over you! Plus, plastic surgery

* The Weekend - Cooking A Thanksgiving Dinner (C0168)

  A: Hello everyone and welcome back to our show. Today we are going to
  learn how to cook the perfect thanksgiving turkey! I will share a secret
  that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook he perfect, most mouth
  watering, juiciest turkey in the world! Let's get started!

  A: First of all, we must bring out or key ingredient; whiskey. You see,
  the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol, brings out the
  flavor of the turkey meat. Let's pour 1 cup of whiskey on the turkey,
  and serve yourself a cup as well! Cheers! Ahhh! That's good 12 year
  whiskey right there. Ok, back to our turkey. Preheat your oven to 475
  degrees Fahrenheit. Now have another cup of whiskey.

  A: Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a
  roasting pan. Let's add some whiskey to give some extra flavor and let's
  have another cup. That hit the spot. There we go, we can leave it in
  there for the next 45 minutes. In the meantime, lets have another sip of
  whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin pie. Visit the Online
  Review and Discussion (text version).

  A: Lightly whisk together 2 eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.
  Once that's ready we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg
  and cinnamon with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan. Slowly bring
  up to simmering point stirring occasionally. Now you may notice that we
  are using some dark rum in this pie. This is because the richness of the
  pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum, so to celebrate this
  great occasion, yourself a glass! Cheers!

  A: Now that we have finished with the filling, let's Bake the pie for 45
  to 50 minutes until the filling has puffed up around the edges and the

  of this great thanksgiving dinner!

  A: After waiting for an hour, and having a couple of drinks, it's time
  to check on our turkey! Take the turkey out of the oven, pick the turkey
  off of the ground. Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe. Now
  also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot! Cheers and
  happy thanksgiving!

  What's going on?

  marriage! What was I thinking? I'm only thirty five years old! I've got
  my entire life ahead of me, adventures waiting! I can't settle down yet!

  were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a
  bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family!

  A: I know I know!

  B: Let's think this through. First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the
  altar. Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the
  woman that you love and the woman of your dreams! Why would you want to
  end that or jeopardize it like this? Second of all, you are just getting
  cold feet. You know deep down inside that you want to marry her, so cut
  the crap and do it!

  B: Yes, actually I'm looking to buy a camera.

  A: We've got a wide selection do you know if you'd like a
  point-and-shoot, or something a little fancier? Are you shopping for
  yourself or for someone else?

  B: Actually I'm buying a camera for my husband.

  A: Ah, well then I'd recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR.

  B: Yeah? Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

  A: Sure thing, follow me. This here is the.

  B: The Canon Eos. Yeah it's ok, but I'm looking for something that
  performs better in low light, has a better display panel, and longer
  battery life.

  A: Oh, ah, um the Nikon D60 is a nice option.

  B: Yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with? I don't want some
  bulky telephoto lens.

  A: Oh, well this one has the, uh.

  B: Looks to me like an 18-55mm lens. pretty standard, that will do. Not
  like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything!

  A: So, ahem, can I interest you in any acc...

  B: Accessories? Do you carry polarizing filters?

  A: Polarizing filter um we should! I'm sorry, ma'am. looks like we're

  A: I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP!

  B: OK, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

  spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend
  tomorrow! She's gonna kill me!

  B: Ok, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also
  very stained. I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

  A: Fine! Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

  B: Certainly.

  A: Great! This is our secret! If you see my wife, say nothing to her
  about this!

* Elementary - The Office - Preparing a Budget (C0173)

  A: Welcome Mr and Mrs. Carnwell, please take a seat.

  B: Thank you.

  A: So I understand that your family spending has sky rocketed and you
  want to start budgeting.

  C: Yes that's correct. Frankly speaking our household income is
  relatively high and we have never had any money problems, but I think
  this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.

  B: We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, ours
  and not to mention our mortgage and car payments. With the recent
  economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need
  some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.

  A: I see. Well you have come to the right place. First what we need to
  do, is determine your cash flow. Knowing how much money is coming in
  will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage,
  education, groceries, etc.

  B: Yes that makes sense.

  A: Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two
  to three months. That way, we can determine what your average
  expenditures are and see which category you are spending money on the
  most. Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we cant do much about
  that, but we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment
  or clothing.

  C: Great! We will do that then! Now how about we treat you to a nice
  dinner?

  A: That's another thing. If you really want to stop spending so much
  money, throw away at least half of your credit cards!

* Elementary - The Weekend - Getting a manicure (C0174)

  A: Honey I'll be right back!

  B: Where are you going?

  A: I told you already! I'm going to. get my nails done.

  B: Again? You just went last week! You spend more time at the nail salon
  than you do here at home! Honestly, why do you need a manicure every
  week?

  A: Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself, and my nails look great.
  You should come with me!

  B: Why? I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that!

  A: They don't only paint my nails! The manicurist will remove my
  cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least nails coats of nail polish!

  B: Yeah, sounds like something I should definitely do.

  <<section-0175.html>>

* Elementary- Global View - New Years Resolution (C0175)

  A: Did you read this? It says that the number one new years resolution
  make is to spend more time with friends and family.

  B: Why would that be funny?

  A: Well, think about it. We are a society that is always on the go, not
  because we have to, but because we want to.

  B: Why?

  A: We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to
  provide for our family with goods and services that are usually
  unnecessary.

  B: I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a
  new year's resolution yourself.

  A: What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by
  February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless.

  B: Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and
  objectives.

  A: What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have
  brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.

  B: Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me
  everyday!

  A: Yeah yeah whatever.

* Elementary - Daily Life - Heating (C0176)

  A: It's freezing in here! Can I turn up the heat?

  B: Don't touch that thermostat! You don't pay the bills around here!

  A: Dad! Are you serious? What's the point of having central heating if
  we can't use it! Look, I can see my breath!

  B: Put on a sweater! I'm not gonna let you run up my heating bill just
  because it's a bit chilly.

  A: Dad! I'm gonna catch a cold!

  B: When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you
  do! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.
  We used it to cook, heat the house and even dry our clothes! We never
  caught a cold. You should be grateful!

  KID: Awesome! I'll go get the Christmas lights!

  HUSBAND: Of course it will. help me put it in the living room.

  KID: I found the lights!

  WIFE: I got the Christmas ornaments! We could also place these stockings

  good old Christmas songs！

  A: Bill. Bill! You gotta help me!

  B: What's wrong? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart
  attack.

  A: Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything! I'm such
  a bad son!

  B: Take it easy! Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if
  there is anything she might like.

  A: That's just it! I don't know what to get her! Last year I got her a
  ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too
  small! I suck at getting presents for people.

  B: That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess
  peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of
  that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much
  you love her. At the same time you should show her that you took the
  time and effort to look for something that she would really like!

  A: Yeah you're right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

  B: Yeah tell me about it. I know! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish
  right? Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I
  saw called SpanishPod.

  A: Now that's a great idea!

  quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first!

  A: Oh, your precious game. You watch the same game every year, and each
  year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals!

  B: Oh no you didn't. You didn't just insult the Salsbury Seals, did you?
  Why don't you just. just go and return all of those stupid clothes and

  A: You got it! I have a new job, I'm living in a new city, with new
  friends! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I
  live my life.

  B: So what are you going to do? Take up an art class or something?

  A: Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking. It's not that I'm
  pinching pennies or anything, it's just that I've been smoking since I
  was sixteen, and I think it's time to stop.

  B: I'm with you on that one. Anything else you're planning on doing?

  A: One last thing, I've decided to come out of the closet.

  first thing about farming!

  A: That's fine! Don't worry about it!

  B: What was that?

  A: Relax, it was just a goat!

  B: And that?

  A: It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them
  later.

  B: What was that?

  A: Honey, seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax!

  A: Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable .

  A: I've had it! I'm done working for a company that is taking me
  nowhere!

  B: So what are you gonna do? Just quit?

  A: That's exactly what I am going to do! I've decided to create my own
  company! I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors and
  start working for myself!

  B: Have you ever written up a business plan before?

  A: Well, it can't be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain
  your business, how you are going to do things and that's it, right?

  B: You couldn't be more wrong! A well written business plan will include
  an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two
  pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information
  such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.

  A: Well that seems easy enough.

  B: Wait, there's more! Then you need to introduce and describe your
  goods or services. What they are and how they are different from
  competitors'? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to
  investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into
  consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many
  children on average the population has! All this information is useful
  so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where
  you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

  A: Geez. Is that all?

  B: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors
  will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate
  sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when
  they will begin to see a return on their investment!

  A: Umm. I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the
  hassle of trying to start up a business!

  A: Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be
  a bridesmaid. I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding,
  but I haven't lost any weight! Look at these love handles.

  B: You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight. I think that's
  where you're going wrong.

  A: Why? If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat
  reserves right?

  B: Not really. You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts
  or saturated fats. Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

  A: So you are saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I
  eat?

  B: Yes! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and
  foods that are high in cholesterol. You can have steamed veggies or
  increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

  A: If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks?

  firm for over ten years.

  B: Yes.

  A: I won't beat around the bush. Sir, I would like a raise. I currently
  have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first.

  B: A raise? Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not
  the right time.

  A: I understand your position, and I know that the current economic
  downturn has had a negative impact on sales, but you must also take into
  consideration my hard work, pro-activeness and loyalty to this company
  for over a decade.

  B: Taking into account these factors, and considering I don't want to
  start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an
  extra five days of vacation time. How does that sound?

  A: Great! It's a deal! Thank you, sir!

  hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers.

  B: Sounds good. I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something
  mid-range.

  A: We have this new HTC smart phone. It comes with the Android OS so you
  can download applications. It also has a built-in camera, mp3 player and
  touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the

  buns.

  A: We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

  B: Yeah, good idea. We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the
  grill. I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it
  gets too hot.

  A: Great! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also
  bringing two big coolers for the beers.

* Elementary-Global View - Daylight Savings Time (C0191)

  A: Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?

  B: What? Why do we have to do that?

  A: Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the
  mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our
  position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to
  take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving
  our clocks forward one hour.

  B: I see. That's convenient! I never understood things like this, such
  as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my
  clock!

  A: That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are
  in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich.
  Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard
  Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich!

  B: That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of
  the huge time difference, even though we left Beijing at noon and flew
  for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon!
  It's like we went back in time!

  weather report with Mike Sanderson.

  Mike: Thank you, Bob! This past week has been the beginning of
  Armageddon for many, a series of unprecedented meteorological events
  occurred around the world. In Switzerland, a major avalanche was
  reported in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured. Due to the
  extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the US Midwest, causing
  classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.

  Mike: Moving to Latin American, Ecuador has suffered a six month drought
  that has not only affected farming, but has also forced the closure of
  the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire
  country. In Chile, a major earthquake that registered seven point five
  on the Richter scale struck the southern region. Losses are reported to
  be in the billions. Authorities have not yet released an official
  statement.

  Bob: Not a great week for the world! Any good news?

  Mike: I'm afraid not, Bob. One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has
  erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region. Meanwhile,
  Mexico 's coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that
  all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit
  Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala and Panama. That's all
  the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the six
  o'clock news. Back to you Bob.

* Elementary-Daily Life-Building Your Dream Home (C0193)

  A: Mr. and Mrs. Robinson! Let's get straight to it. You have saved up
  your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home. What
  did you have in mind?

  B: A suburban bungalow straight out of the sixties! A perfect lawn with
  minimal landscaping. A brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned
  grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool. A two-car carport,
  pastel siding and a gable roof. Completed with white shutters and a
  white picket fence !

  C: Uh, honey?

  B: In the living room we would have moss-green rugs and a fireplace with
  a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls. In the kitchen, the
  cupboards would be a pale yellow and we would have a turquoise metal
  oven and vinyl flooring -

  C: Umm, sweetie, but I was thinking of a more modern style house. An
  open concept house, all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.

  B: But sweetums, there is always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of
  homes. Besides, it's just a fad. It doesn't have the homey feeling the
  old homes do.

  C: Sweetie-pie it's not a lot of wasted space. It is relaxing and the
  house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed
  to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in
  the summer. We would have solar panels on the roof -

  B: Do you know how much those things cost?

  C: What about your vintage furniture, dearest? And instead of a lawn,
  which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally
  harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a
  garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food!

  B: But buttercup, I thought you always said that you loved visiting your
  grandmother's house!

* Elementary -The Weekend - Stir Fry (C0194)

  A: Oh, man. I had the best supper last night. My wife made a stir fry
  and it was amazing!

  B: I love stir fry Crispy bite-sized vegetables covered in a mixture of
  soy sauce and oyster sauce. Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts. Throw
  in some onion and garlic and ginger! Mmm! Mmm! It's almost lunchtime. I
  would die for a plate of stir fry right now!

  A: Well, you can keep the vegetables, I'll take the meat. The stir fry
  my wife made was really hearty, with chunks of beef and slivers of bell
  peppers and onion...

  B: What? You call that a stir fry? More meat than vegetables? That's the
  worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry What a disgrace to
  the wok she fried it in! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without
  the wrap! Silly Americans!

* Elementary -Global View - Job Hunting (C0195)

  A: Woo hoo! This just might be the start of the rest of my life!

  B: What happened?

  A: I'm in the market for a job! I went on a website with hundreds of job
  listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a
  few employers I would like to work for. I have the resume I wrote for
  English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to
  write. I've even done my research and found the names of the managers so
  I can address the letters personally. And you know I can be charming in
  interviews. Goodbye my penniless days! Hello salary and a career!

  B: Ben, we're fifteen. What kind of job are you looking for?

  A: Oh, just for a position as a gas station attendant. You know,
  starting at a simple lowly job, just like all the greats before they
  made it big in the world.

  B: Uh-huh.

  A: But I'm just in it for the money, right? How else am I going to be
  able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies? Besides, I love the
  smell of gasoline, don't you?

  about we get you measured? Let's start off by measuring the width of
  your shoulders. Now, let's measure the length of your arms and this bit
  around your neck here.

  B: Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar? My
  neck gets easily irritated.

  A: No problem! Now for your pants, let me just measure your waist and
  the inseam.

  B: You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area. I
  tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays.

  A: OK. Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design. Please follow
  me.

  and a lifeguard! Can anyone tell me what these people have in common?

  B: They save people from bad things?

  A: That's right! Now class, if something bad happened and you had to get
  help, do you know what phone number you would call?

  C: 911!

  A: Yes, you would pick up the phone and dial 911. What are some
  emergency situations where you would need to dial 911?

  B: If my grandpa has a heart attack!

  C: If there is an accident!

  B: If a robber breaks into the house!

  C: If the fire alarm goes off!

  B: Pff! I wouldn't call 911 if the fire alarm went off in my house. The
  only time that ever happens is when we're having spaghetti for supper,
  and Mom burns the garlic bread, as usual.

* Elementary -Daily Life - Applying CPR (C0198)

  A: Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course. First of
  all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?

  B: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!

  A: That's right! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary
  arrest.

  B: What does that mean?

  A: Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood, or your lungs stop
  pumping air, then we need to get them going again! That's when we have
  to apply this procedure. Let's begin! I need a volunteer.

  B: Me! Me!

  A: Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let's suppose this
  young woman has stopped breathing. We must lift the person's chin so
  that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our
  mouth over the other person's mouth and blow air two or three times,
  like this.

  B: Wait, what are you doing? I'm a married woman! You can't just try to
  kiss me like this!

  A: Ma' am I'm not trying to kiss you! I am trying to demonstrate how to
  apply CPR in the case of an emergency.

  B: Well, ok. But no French kissing!

  A: As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner. Once
  this is done, we must try to get the heart going again. To do this, we
  place our hands over the person's chest, and press down firmly two or
  three times.

  B: Wait, what are you doing! You can't just kiss me then go for second
  base!

* Elementary-Global View-Learning About First Aid (C0199)

  A: Hey Joe! Where have you been these past few days?

  B: I've been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week
  ago at the Red Cross.

  A: Cool! I've always wanted to do something like that! Have you learned
  anything useful?

  B: For sure! I mean we've learned how to apply pressure to stop
  bleeding, how to check for a pulse, and even how to apply CPR!

  A: Have you treated any real emergencies?

  B: Well, they took us along with some paramedics. There was this guy who
  fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of
  compound fractures. His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush
  him to the hospital. It was intense!

  A: I can imagine! I tend to faint when I see blood, so I think I won't
  be taking up a course like that anytime soon!

  B: All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza, fries, burgers and
  hot dogs! You have to start eating better!

  A: What are you talking about? I have salads sometimes.

  B: Yeah right! I'm serious! You should also cut down on your sugar
  intake as well. You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose
  syrup! It's really not healthy!

  A: Fine! I'll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low
  in fat. Are you happy now?

  B: It's a start, but I'll be happy when I see you stick to your promise!

  weigh that package, too.

  B: Great. How much is this going to cost?

  A: Well, it depends. Do you want to send it via priority, express or
  standard mail?

  B: What's the difference?

  A: Well, standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is
  a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.
  Express is the fastest, but it's also the most expensive. It only takes
  three days and you can track your package online.

  B: I see. Well, there's no rush. Please send it via priority mail.
  Please be extra careful, the contents of the package are fragile.

* Elementary -Global View - Understanding a Trial (C0204)

  Lawyer: Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, My client, Robert
  Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit. The prosecution
  has accused my client of being a pickpocket! I know we have heard the
  testimony of many people here today, . . . . people who claim the
  defendant, my client, stole their wallets. I feel sorry for these
  victims, I really do. . . . . . . . . but my client is innocent!

  did not actually see the defendant steal anything. . . . . . . . . .

  Mr. Smith: I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I
  can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance
  here is lovely!

  Mr. Johnson: No problem, if possible I always combine business with
  pleasure. Now, let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

  Mr. Smith: Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole
  distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States.
  They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury
  market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I
  think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and
  serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for
  providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.

  Mr. Johnson: Hmmm, sounds interesting. . . . gourmet chocolates , where
  are they produced? Belgium?

  Mr. Smith: Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

  Mr. Johnson: Really? I didn't think they were known for their luxury
  chocolate production. . .

  Mr. Smith: That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The
  government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export
  markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over
  one thousand units. They've also reduced the red tape involved at
  customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!

  Mr. Johnson: Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, smooth. . . .

  Mr. Smith: Unique aren't they? I bet you've never tasted anything like
  it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no
  one's cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the cr `eme de la cr
  `eme make it through inspection.

  Mr. Johnson: Yes, very interesting flavors. . . . . . . Slightly spicy,
  very unique, that's for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients?

  Mr. Smith: I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret
  recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I'm
  sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.

  Mr. Johnson: Haggis? What's Haggis?

  Mr. Smith: It's a traditional Scottish delicacy; you take sheep's liver,
  heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep's stomach.

  Mr. Johnson: Ah, get back to you.

  Mr. Smith: Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson?

  B: Yeah what's up?

  A: Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me
  your half.

  B: Yeah I wanted to talk to you about that. I agreed we would go halves
  on all the bills, but frankly I think it's unfair.

  A: Unfair! Why?

  B: Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning. I
  don't. You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents. I
  don't. You see what I'm getting at here?

  A: You leave the air conditioner on day and night! You also take 30
  minute showers which means you are using way more gas and water than me!

  B: Well, while we are at it, stop bringing your friends over for drinks
  every weekend. You always leave a mess and keep me up all night!

  A: You are shopping for a pillow online? That's absurd!

  B: Why? I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find
  what I'm looking for. This way, I just search for it online quick and
  easy.

  A: I see, but how do you pay for it? How do you know you aren't going to
  be ripped off by the seller?

  B: Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does
  something wrong, people comment negatively and then you know that he or
  she may not be trustworthy.

  A: Wow, that sounds pretty safe. So how do you pay? Do you need a credit
  card?

  B: You can use a credit card or your debit card. They also let you use
  the PayPal system which is really safe and fast. I have never had any
  problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

  A: Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

  B: You can find anything! Are you sure you want to start shopping online
  though? Once you step into this world, there is no turning back!

  B: What is it?

  A: Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot
  of money!

  B: What do you mean? What happened?

  A: There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points,
  the DOW JONES indicator also suffered! Our portfolio is worth half of
  what it was worth points week ago.

  B: How is this possible? You are supposed to be talking to our
  stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are
  safe and making a profitable return!

  A: I know sir! We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market
  all of a sudden. On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash
  bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our
  loses and reinvest in emerging markets. We could potentially make this
  tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

  B: Do what you have to do! One other thing, don't tell the rest of the
  stockholders about this. If they find out, it's the end of this company!

  Joanne: Fine with me. I just want to get this over with. It's important
  we make a clean break. I should have signed a pre-nup.

  Je: What was that?

  Joanne: Nothing! Anyway, you're right, there's no reason this has to be
  nasty. My lawyer tells me you've accepted our alimony proposal and the
  division of property, as well as the custody agreement- I keep the cat
  and you get the dog. So that's done. . . . finally.

  Je: Let's not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let's start with the record
  collection, I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your
  cheesy disco albums back.

  gave it to me.

  hardly ever use it!

  Joanne: He's my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway!

  Je: Whatever! Alright, I'll concede the silly gramophone, if you'll
  agree that I get the silver tea set.

  Joanne: How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set?
  Fine! I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What's

  the Trevi fountain, and we got caught in the rain. . . .

  Je: . . . and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to
  take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and
  laughing in the rain. . . .

  Joanne: Oh, we really did have fun back then didn't we?

  Je: Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has
  been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can't reconcile and
  try again? I still love you.

  Joanne:Oh Jeff! I love you too! I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who
  keeps the motorcycle.

  Je: The motorcycle? But that's mine!

* Elementary -Global View - Baby Shower (C0219)

  A: Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me! I've always
  been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me! Let's get
  started!

  B: Ok, let's start opening some presents!

  A: Oh look! What a great little bib for the baby! This will definitely
  come in handy! Oh wow, you also got me a stroller! That's so great!
  Thank you!

  B: This next one is from Betty.

  A: A highchair and car seat! Wow Betty thank you so much! I really
  appreciate it!

  B: One more from Carla.

  A: A playpen and crib! Thanks Carla! This is just what I needed!

  B: OK, that's all of them. No more gifts. Now who wants to guess when
  the baby is due!

  A: Umm. I think my water just broke! Get me to a hospital!

  B: Fine! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee
  table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things.

  A: Great! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I'll also get a
  bean bag and a dining set.

  B: While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner? I really want
  one so I can watch TV.

  A: Car trouble center. How may I help you?

  B: My car won't start! Stupid old car!

  A: Hold on, before you kick your car let's go through some possible
  problems.

  B: Fine.

  A: Ok, first of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?

  B: Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug
  or the starter motor.

  A: Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do
  you hear the starter motor crank?

  B: Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but
  nothing else happens. The engine won't start. Should I maybe press the
  accelerator?

  A: No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor
  and your car will never start.

  B: So what do you think it is?

  A: I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have
  gasoline?

  B: Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started! Thanks for your help! I told
  you to fill the tank!

* Elementary -Global View - Carbon Footprint (C0222)

  A: So what's your guys' take on all this global warming hysteria in the
  media?

  B: It's pretty serious, man. There have been tons of scientific studies
  and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up. We need
  to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our
  planet.

  A: I don't know. It sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo if you ask me.
  ”Save the earth!” The earth will save itself. It's survived worst
  disasters in the past. I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies. There's
  no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in
  the winter. And we have no bus system. My house is forty years old and
  it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be ”green” and
  ”energy-efficient”.

  C: Well I don't really know if I believe in global warming either, or
  whether or not it was our doing or a natural change the earth is going
  through, but you have to admit that we're living pretty irresponsibly
  here in the west.

  A: I guess...

  C: I think the issue at hand is sustainability. We've only got this one
  earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing because
  of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but
  ourselves and anything but the present.

  B: So, like I was saying, we need to change the way we live. We need to
  reduce our carbon footprint.

  C: But it doesn't have to be that drastic. Hybrid vehicles and solar
  panels are too expensive to be feasible right now. And we don't have to
  be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either,
  though it helps.

  B: I car pool to work everyday with some buddies of mine. I have a rain
  barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the
  summer, and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get
  my groceries. And we just started using bio-degradable plastic made from
  corn oil for take-out orders at my family's restaurant. Remember the
  three R's? Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.

  C: Exactly, it's just small simple changes, like buying energy-saving
  light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using
  reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.

  A: Like the ones we're drinking out of?

  B: Yeah.

  his lip.

  Paul: un-uh hmmm.. . , like this?

  Sally: Yes, that's the mustache! But the beard isn't right, mean, it
  didn't cover his whole face. . . . think it was just on his chin.

  Officer: A goatee? Was it like Paul's?

  Brown:

  Sally: Ah yes, that's it, he had a goatee.........

  Paul: Ok, what about sideburns? Did he have sideburns?

  Paul: Alright, was this the man you saw?

  Sally: Yes, that's him! Hmmmmm, he looks a lot like you.

  afternoon?

* Elementary -Global View - Crime Scene (C0224)

  Detective MeGee: Alright, Officer McGraw, Give it to me straight, what
  are we looking at here?

  McGraw: Detective MeGee! We're glad to see you! We could sure use your
  expertise on this one. It's a break-in, but nothing seems to have been
  stolen. We received a call from the Bear family at around ten thirty
  this morning. They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came
  home to this mess! Broken chairs and porridge all over the place!
  Apparently, Momma Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see,
  and they were waiting for it to cool down.

  Detective MeGee: Okay then, let's start examining the evidence. . . .
  Have the forensics team been in yet?

  McGraw: Yes sir. They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are
  analyzing them back at the lab as we speak. Hopefully, they will be able
  to identify the burglar soon.

  Detective MeGee: Hmmmm, Ah ha! What's this? A strand of golden hair. . .
  . . . this is a very important piece of trace evidence McGraw. It tells
  me the suspect has long golden hair. . . . . . . very few men have long
  golden hair. . . . . . . our criminal could be a woman. . . . . .

  McGraw: A woman? Was she working alone? Did she have an accomplice?

  Detective MeGee: An accomplice? No, no McGraw, she was definitely
  working alone. See here, there are footprints in the porridge, here on
  the floor. . . . footprints, tells me that our suspect is small. . . .
  could possibly be a child.

  McGraw: A child? Surely not, sir. . .

  Detective MeGee: We must follow the clues, McGraw! The evidence doesn't
  lie! Now, let's reconstruct the crime. . . . . . the suspect came in,
  sat in each chair breaking the smallest one into little pieces. Next,
  the porridge. she obviously tried to eat it and because it was so hot,
  she dropped it on the floor. . . . this mess. interesting. These
  footprints seem to lead upstairs. McGraw, did your officers clear the
  scene?

  McGraw: Well, there was no one down here. . . and maybe we forget to
  check upstairs.

  Goldylocks: Hey! What's with all the noise? I'm trying to sleep up here!

  Detective MeGee: There she is! Get her!

  Ralph: You, umm. . . ah. . . . yeah, you'll take off your hat and
  scratch your head!

  Sammy: Right. When I take my hat off and scratch my head, you do what?

  Ralph: I get in the box.

  Frankie: Right, you get in the box. I'll make sure it's all sealed and
  then, posing as a delivery guy, I'll drop off a ‘special package' for
  the manager. Now, according to Jimmy, the bank manager is leaving early
  on Tuesday 'cause it's his wedding anniversary. He and the wife are
  having a romantic rendezvous in the country, so any packages delivered
  will be left unopened in his office until he gets back late on
  Wednesday. . . .

  Sammy: . . . . . . Which gives us access to his office for at least Come
  hours. . . . Ralph, this is where you come in. . . . where are you?

  office?

  Ralph: I stay in the box until the bank has closed, . I get out of the
  box.

  Sammy: . . . . then? What next, Ralph? Oh for Pete's sake! This is never
  going to work.

  Ralph: Hey, give me a chance here, fellas! I, um, I crack the safe .
  then, then I take the money. . . . then I. . . ummmmm, I get back in the
  box.

  Frankie: 'Atta boy Ralph! In the morning I come back to the bank, say
  there's been a mix-up with the delivery I made and take the ‘special
  package' back here.

  Sammy: Alright, let's get some sleep. . . it's a big day tomorrow
  fellas!

  Frankie: A perfect plan, Sammy! It went off without a hitch!

  Sammy: Let's open this up and get Ralph out here so we can start
  counting the money!

  Ralph: Phew! I sure am glad to see you guys! I was sure getting lonely
  with no one to talk.

  Frankie: That's nice, ok how much!

* Elementary -Global View - Fundraiser (C0226)

  A: Ok Mark, it's your turn to ring the doorbell. I did it last time.

  B: I hate going door to door, and I hate asking for money.

  A: But we need to raise enough money for the school fundraiser so that
  our class can win the pizza party! You do want to have a pizza party,
  don't you?

  B: Yes, but...

  A: Just go already!

  B: No one's coming.

  A: Try again.

  B: Maybe there's no one home.

  A: Of course there's someone home! There are two cars in the driveway
  and I see lights on in the house! Hello! Anybody home? We would like to
  know if you want to sponsor us in our school fundraiser. Fifty percent
  of the profits go towards the new school playground!

  B: I don't know why anyone would want what's in this catalog anyway.
  It's just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments, Cd's of old people
  singing Christmas songs, and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of
  chocolates.

  A: You don't like chocolates?

  B: Not this kind. They've got weird names like ganache and praline.

  A: Look! I just saw someone walking around inside! These people are
  being very rude!

  A: Finally, someone's coming!

  B: They don't look too happy.

  A: Hi, sir. Would you like to sponsor us or make a donation to.

  C: What grade are you kids in?

  A: Grade seven.

  C: Then for goodness sake, don't you see this sign? Can't you read?

* Elementary -Daily Life - Wedding Planning (C0227)

  A: Trina, will you marry me?

  B: Yes! Yes! And yes! Jared of course I'll marry you!

  A: Oh Babe, I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I can't
  wait for all the adventures we're going to have, for all the fights and
  the laughter. I can't wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.

  B: Oh Jared! I can't wait for our wedding! I hope you don't mind, but
  I've already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa
  saw you buying the ring last month so I've had plenty of time to start
  planning!

  A: She what?

  B: Oh don't worry sweetie, I didn't know when you were going to propose.
  It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I've got it all planned
  out. There's almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we
  will have roughly four hundred guests attending.

  A: four hundred?

  B: No need to sweat it My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding,
  which is going to be low budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people,
  which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception
  venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents'
  church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We'll meet with him
  soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony
  was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care
  of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would
  also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she's
  going to be a professional opera singer?

  A: Ah...

  B: And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our
  caterers for the banquet and we'll get the Youth Group to serve us. I
  was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the
  night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a
  DJ. Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that
  does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that
  we could have an island paradise- themed wedding and our theme color
  would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine.

  And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where
  we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink
  mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle
  could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!

  A: Wow.

  B: See? It's going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be
  everything I ever dreamed of.

  A: If I survive the next six months.

  Ok kids, put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp. Here,
  Mary, help me lay down these beach towels.

  B: Ok kids, here's a beach ball and a Frisbee, a pail and a shovel. I
  want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave. Don't stray
  too far. Wait! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes.

  A: And stay in the shallow area. I don't want to see you go any farther
  than that sandbar! It's too deep out there and we didn't bring your
  floaties.

  B: You're back already? The water was too cold, huh? I'll tell you a
  secret. Do you see that small pool of water over there? It'll be warmer
  in there. Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows.

  A: What is that? A jellyfish? Jeremy, put that down right now! It could
  sting you!

  young adults.

  Jacob: Oooo, Mom, can I get these?

  Jacob: They're Chuck Taylor's! Everyone has them! Can I, please?

  Mom: I don't know. Would they go with your clothes? The backs are really
  high. and the way the tongue just sticks up. They're almost like a boot.
  And the sole doesn't look like it would have a very good grip.

  next?

  A: I'll till the soil and then sow the seeds. I'll then add some

* Elementary -Daily Life - Buying Women's Shoes (C0231)

  Mom: Hi, excuse me Miss? I'm looking for a dress shoe. My usual pair
  that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape. They
  don't provide any support anymore.

  Salesgirl: Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for? We've got
  strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps, or if you're looking for
  something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

  Mom: Show me some classic high heels, please.

  Salesgirl: Ok, right this way. What color did you have in mind?

  Mom: Black. Classic.

  Salesgirl: Of course. We've got this style here that is very popular.
  Because it's an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.
  They look great on everyone.

  Mom: Umm. too shiny. And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let's look
  for a closed-toe shoe.

  Salesgirl: Ok, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a
  two-inch heel so they are very comfortable.

  Mom: I don't like the pointed toes. Let me take a look at what else you
  have. Too high. That one looks like the back would cut into my heel. I
  have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly. I don't want
  bows. I find sling backs very uncomfortable. Those might as well be
  stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally, this is what I'm looking for.

  Salesgirl: What size?

  Mom: Seven-and-a-half.

  Salesgirl: Here we are How does it fit?

  Mom: Hmmm. not good. They're too tight. The length is right, but the
  shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes. And there'd be no room for
  my insoles. You know what? I don't think I have the patience for this
  today. They just don't make shoes like they used to. I'll come back
  another time.

  Salesgirl: Have a nice day, Ma'am.

  second decision and sold all my RMB at an amazing bid! I've also done
  some trading with CHF and AUD and HKD. I've made some good profits but

  woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.
  I think I am coming down with the flu.

  Doctor Evans: Ah I see, yes you do sound rather croaky. Well let's have
  a look, shall we? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah”.

  Chloe: ”Ahhhhhhhh”

  Doctor Evans: Good, yes, your tonsils are a little swollen and red. How
  are your ears, blocked at all?

  I really feel terrible.

  Doctor Evans: Ok Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me
  while I listen to your chest? You really are all bunged up, you don't
  sound too good at all. Ok I'm going to set you up with a bunch of
  antibiotics. You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and
  these blue pills every evening. You will also have to take this cough
  medicine three times a day after meals. Finally, I am giving you an
  inhaler to use every time you feel breathless. . . just to clear up your
  lungs!

  Chloe: Whoa! So many drugs. . . . I hate swallowing pills. Am I able to
  go to work?

  Doctor Evans: Absolutely not! You are highly contagious! You don't want
  to infect the rest of your co-workers do you? I recommend staying in bed
  for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get
  weak and dehydrated. You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and
  movies!

* Elementary -Daily Life - Trying To Sleep (C0236)

  Jill: Alex, what's up with you? You look dreadful!

  Alex: Hey Jill, I don't know. I've been having trouble sleeping these
  past few weeks. I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep .
  I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to
  bed . I've tried eating and not eating different foods. I've even tried
  counting sheep! And then when I finally get to sleep , I have these
  really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more
  tired than before I went to sleep .

  Jill: Wow, maybe you should get that checked out. Maybe you're stressed?

  C: Just take some sedatives! Works for me! Every so often having some
  melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping . It works on
  all kinds of sleeping disorders . It's the stuff pilots use to regulate
  their sleeping patterns .

  Jill: I heard of that. But does that apply to Alex's situation?

  C: Ya sure, why not ? Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since
  it's a recent thing so taking melatonin do the trick.

  Jill: But shouldn't he be looking into WHY it's been happening?

  C: Well aren't you the little psychologist? Our buddy's having trouble
  sleeping , it's easy and curable. It's not something freakish like if he
  was a sleepwalker.

  Alex: Well, there's that too.

* Elementary -Daily Life - Morning Routine (C0237)

  Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about
  when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half
  ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get
  ready the morning?

  Stephanie: It's a skill. What can I say? I don't know why, I just have a
  long routine.

  Jacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl's
  routine be so complicated? You get up , you shower, you get dressed ,
  you brush your teeth, you're out the door. Half an hour, tops.

  Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely
  needs styling. I don't. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to
  get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for
  the shower. Every second day , I wash my hair. If it's a hair-washing
  day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really
  oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out
  too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in
  under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get
  dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed
  in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the
  night before , but usually I do it in the morning. In all , getting
  dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry
  so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I'll put my hair up,
  but oftentimes I blow-dry it straight. And then, because of the texture
  of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing.
  That's another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup
  routine.

  Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your
  makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how
  long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?

  Stephanie: Not funny.

* Elementary -The Office - Interview Skills Part 2 - Discussing Your
  Background (C0238)

  Mr. Parsons: Now, Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I've had
  the chance to look it over and I must say I'm quite impressed.

  Rebecca: Thank you very much. I've tried to keep it short and clear. If
  there's any questions please feel free to ask me.

  Mr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps
  first you could give me a brief overview I'd like to get a little bit of
  an idea of your background.

  Rebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see from the resume I'm up and
  grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when
  I was quite young, at around rook.

  Mr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe?

  Rebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would
  definitely call London home. But as you see I've actually spent a lot of
  my life moving from country to country. My Father was in the oil
  business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi
  Arabia too.

  Mr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous
  childhood.

  Rebecca: Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I'm
  really looking to settle down.

  Mr. Parsons: I see. Okay, well let's move on to discuss your education
  shall we?

  Rebecca: Sure.

  our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

  B: Ok. How about we get a cat or a ferret!

  A: We're planning on having children soon, I don't think those animals
  are a good idea with a baby in the house.

  B: Fine! Let's get a bird then! We can keep it in its cage and teach it
  to talk! A parrot would be awesome!

  from there .

  Mr. Parsons: Now, if I look here I see that you completed a BA in
  English?

  Rebecca: Yes, that's right. After graduating from high school in New
  York I attended York University in the UK. My major was English, and my
  minor was business studies. I completed my BA in 2004.

  Mr. Parsons: Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

  Rebecca: Yes that's right. I've always enjoyed studying. My friends say
  I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed
  academically.

  Mr. Parsons: Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca. So
  how about extracurricular activities at University?

  Rebecca: Well I've always been keen on on writing, so I became the
  editor for the University student magazine, which I really loved. Also I
  volunteered for a group called Shelter, to help the homeless in York.

  Mr. Parsons: What did that involve?

  Rebecca: Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter
  months. I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

  Mr. Parsons: I'm sure. Okay, now let's move on to your work experience,
  shall we?

  Rebecca: Yes, okay.

* 242: Learning The Piano (Upper-Intermediate, Global View)

  Charles: Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week?

  Cody: Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I
  didn't get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered
  the tricky section.

  Charles: Great! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first. Good,
  good. This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the
  last part with the sixteenth note. Now let's take a look at this tricky
  section.

  Cody: Charles? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a
  small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again
  over here?

  Charles: It might work. I'll have to hear it. Show me what you've done.
  Not bad , not bad.

  Cody: It was horrible! I played play it much better at home!

  Charles: It's just nerves. Just play the right hand for now. One two
  three four five six, ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, good. Don't forget the
  accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but
  now it's a G-natural. Now add the bass clef. You're going too fast.
  Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.

  Cody: Is that better?

  Charles: Yes, much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.
  What was that?

  Cody: Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

  Charles: That's ok, keep going, you're moving ahead by leaps and bounds
  . Watch your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted. Remember to stroke the
  keys, don't pound. That's better! Remember that as a pianist or any
  other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack
  just as much or more so as your musicianship.

  Mr. Parsons: Right Rebecca. Now I see that after graduating from
  University your first job was.......

  Rebecca: For a local paper in York called the York Herald. Actually, I
  started with them as an intern in the beginning. I was really keen on
  getting some experience in the journalism, and this seemed like a good
  first step.

  Mr. Parsons: Certainly. And after your internship?

  Rebecca: They seemed impressed, and offered me a position as a junior
  local news reporter. I ended up staying two years there actually. I was
  in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper. I really enjoyed
  it there, and it really helped me build my skills.

  Mr. Parsons: Yes I see. But you decided to leave them in 2006 right?

  Rebecca: Yes, that's right. My husband and I moved to London, and so I
  managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London.

  Mr. Parsons: The London Weekly right?

  Rebecca: Yes, in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but
  it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

  sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive.

  and coffee for all of our passengers.

  Mr. Parsons: Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job. I
  see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right?

  Rebecca: Yes, that's right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough
  for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn't have
  many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

  Mr. Parsons: So, what changed?

  Rebecca: Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor
  liked me so he promoted me to features writer .

  Mr. Parsons: Wow, a real step up!

  Rebecca: Yes I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I
  spent three years in that position, but to be honest it wasn't an area
  of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term.

   Mr. Parsons: I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?

  Rebecca: I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new
  opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.

* 249: Making A Sandwich (Upper-intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the
  perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let's get started !

  A: Let's start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient
  here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the
  following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed
  sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or
  grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

  A: Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients ! Of
  course, each person's palate is different, but I'm going to give you a
  few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the
  perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in
  your sandwich.

  A: Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste
  and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices
  here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or
  chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can't go wrong with them. As
  for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first
  grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

  A: Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can
  add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of
  salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or
  even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It's always a good idea to cut
  your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your
  ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!

  A: That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where
  we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time!

  describe your key strengths?

  Rebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned before I'm someone who needs
  new challenges. I'm really focused and hard hard-working. I think my
  academic results prove this.

  Mr. Parsons: Yes, true, but how about other personal qualities?

  Rebecca: Well I believe I'm a good team-player, but I can also work well
  independently. I'm very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues
  would agree, I'm fun to work with.

  Mr. Parsons: What would you say is your most positive quality?

  Rebecca: Hmmmmm, that's a tough question. But I would have to say my
  passion. I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my
  career.

  A: I'm hungry, let's go grab a bite to eat.

  B: Yeah me too. Oh! Can we stop at the shop really fast? I lost my
  makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

  A: Will you take long?

  B: No! Five minutes I promise!

  A: Come on! We have been here for almost an hour! I thought you said you
  were only going to get a few things! How long does it take you to pick
  out a lipstick and some nail polish!

  B: Are you crazy! You have no idea what you are talking about! Just for
  my eyes I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an
  eyebrow pencil and mascara. Then I need to get foundation, liquid
  foundation.

  A: Whoa whoa whoa! Are you nuts? How much is all this going to cost? I'm
  looking at the price at each one of these little things and it's
  outrageous! This is basically a crayon!

  B: What about you? You spend as much or more money on your razors, after
  shave, cologne and gel! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes
  and...

  A: Fine! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!

* 252: Contraceptives (Intermediate, Global View)

  A: Alright, settle down everyone. As part of this school's curriculum
  we'll be covering sex ed this week.

  A: Now I want everyone to take this class seriously, sexual education is
  very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think
  of. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

  B: Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to
  teach us like Kama sutra stuff like that?

  A: No Jason, that's not exactly what sex ed is. Basically, we will talk
  about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and
  female bodies work.

  B: My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends
  call the pill. I never really understood what that is, but I know it has
  to do with sex or something.

  A: Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class,
  contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that
  exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to
  prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting
  STD's from an infected person. Another popular method is using condoms.
  This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only
  prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from
  STD's. Yes Jason?

  B: What are condoms made out of? How exactly is it that a woman gets
  pregnant?

  A: Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called Latex. As
  for your other question, that's a whole new class.

  your weaknesses.

  Rebecca: Okay, well it's always more difficult to describe them isn't
  it?

  Mr. Parsons: Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what
  would it be?

  Rebecca: Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I
  don't see progress in my work or career. I suppose I'm quite a restless
  character. My father always taught me to be a high achiever so.

  Mr. Parsons: So would you say if things don't go your way at work it
  could easily get you down?

  Rebecca: Well, in a way yes. But I must say that even if I'm not
  completely happy in my work I always give 110% I would never shirk my
  responsibilities. I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

  Mr. Parsons: Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so
  you do need to keep pushing yourself it's true. Okay well let's move on

* 255: The Miracle Of Life (Upper-Intermediate, Global View)

  A: Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the
  miracle of life. Many of you may think you already know how babies come
  to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking
  about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector
  please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is?

  B: Looks like a goat head to me!

  A: Nice try, but this is a woman's womb which contains her uterus and
  ovaries. The ovaries. are packed with eggs and each month during the
  middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one
  of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of
  ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day
  cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days,
  counting day 1 as the first day of your last period.

  B: That's amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then
  waits for them to be fertilized?

   A: Actually, every woman is already born with over four hundred
  thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released
  during her fertile period.

  B: What about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff.

  A: That's right! The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm
  twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred
  million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of
  a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

  B: So, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have
  babies right?

  A: Yes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate
  sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those
  millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus
  to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes
  to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way
  and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only
  one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg
  instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is
  safely inside.

  B: And then? That's it?

  A: Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its
  release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic
  material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start
  dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new
  cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the
  fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any other
  questions? Then let's move on.

  Mr. Parsons: Well feel free to ask me anything, and I'll try to fill in

  B: What am I doing? What am I doing? Don't you know what day it is?

  A: Ummm. no.

  B: It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking
  off.

  A: What?

  B: The World Cup! The first match is today! It's Mexico vs. South
  Africa! It's going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very
  strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will
  probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and
  all.

  A: I have no idea what you're talking about. The only sporting event we
  watch at home is the Super Bowl.

  B: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries
  compete against each other every four years and fight to win that
  trophy. They first start in a group stage with 8 groups, each group
  having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before
  going on to the semifinals and quarter finals.

  A: Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

  B: Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final
  match of the World Cup! It's a very exciting and nerve wracking sport!
  Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next
  champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their
  belt; they're really good!

  A: All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that
  players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty
  kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me!

  B: Whatever dude, I'm going to go watch the opening match.

* 258: You're Grounded! (Elementary, Daily Life)

  A: Do you know what time it is?

  B: Um. Ten?

  A: Get in this door young man. It's midnight, you are two hours past
  curfew.

  B: I know, but it wasn't my fault! I told Jennifer she had to drop me
  off before ten, but she wouldn't leave the party!

  A: I don't care! You are grounded for life mister!

  B: Mom! That is so unfair!

  A: You know the rules and you broke them. No allowance and no TV for a
  week. I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot
  down!

  B: What! For being a couple of hours late? You have to be kidding!

  A: I don't want to hear it! Now go to your room!

* 259: Interview Skills 9 - Asking For Information About The Position...

  Rebecca: Could you tell me a little about the organization? For example,
  how big is your workforce here?

  Mr. Parsons: Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong
  Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing. The newsdesk staff
  in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

  Rebecca: I see. And how about the working hours?

  Mr. Parsons: Well, as you know Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not
  exactly 9-5. You could be on call at any time. But we do have to work
  very unsociable hours at times. 

  Rebecca: Well I am used to that Mr. Parsons, so that's not really a
  shock for me.

  Mr. Parsons: Good, as long as you understand that.

  Rebecca: And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?

  Mr. Parsons: Yesterday! But no, we are hoping to start from the
  beginning of next month.

  Rebecca: That sounds ideal.

* 260: Guns (Intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: Hey Nick, what are you up to?

  B: Not much, just heading over to the shooting range. You wanna come?

  A: Seriously? You mean to fire a real weapon? I don't know man.

  B: Yeah it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to
  shoot. I also have a revolver that's really fun too! They have big
  targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

  A: Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons
  like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti
  tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!

  B: Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don't get carried away. These weapons
  are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly.
  There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. For
  example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.
  Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber, and never put your
  finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!

  A: Wow, I didn't know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!

  B: The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a
  lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready?

  A: Let's do it!

  describe someone's face, and you guess who it is!

  B: Ok!

  A: Let's see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!

  B: Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a
  mole on her chin!

  A: Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! Ok, my turn. He has a crooked nose
  and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, he is
  also bald!

  B: Your future husband!

  A: Not funny.

  Mr. Parsons: Well Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for
  now?

  Rebecca: I don't think so Mr. Parsons. I think you have covered all the
  main points for me.

  Mr. Parsons: Okay well listen, here is my business card with my mobile
  number. If any other questions spring to mind don't hesitate to contact
  me. Of course you can also call Miss Childs too.

  Rebecca: Great. Ermm, when can I expect to hear from you?

  Mr. Parsons: Well, we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow,
  so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week. Miss
  Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday. How does that
  sound?

  Rebecca: That sounds perfect. Thank you very much for taking the time to
  speak to me Mr. Parsons.

  Mr. Parsons: The pleasure's all mine Rebecca.

  Rebecca: I hope to hear from you very soon.

  Mr. Parsons: Absolutely. Thanks for coming Rebecca. Goodbye.

* 263: Nationalities (Upper-Intermediate, Global View)

  A: Hey! How was your first day of class? I'm in level two and I'm loving
  my class this semester! It's great being in a class of international
  students!

  B: Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess
  it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I
  should improve a lot this semester.

  A: That's both fortunate and unfortunate. It's the United Nations in my
  class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans,
  a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a
  New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we
  have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two
  Indonesians!

  B: That's quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from
  Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese,
  Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

  A: Well, I think you're pretty lucky actually. You'll have the
  opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

  B: I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my
  classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change
  classes.

  A: Don't! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally
  grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

  B: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.

  A: Well, there is that, yes.

* 264: Toothache (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A: What seems to be the problem?

  B: I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is swollen and I can't eat
  anything.

  A: Let's have a look. Hmmm. This doesn't look too good. I think we may
  have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It's pressing against your molars
  and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

  B: When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and
  the root?

  A: First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with. I
  also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a
  filling.

  B: I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three
  times a day.

  A: It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. In any
  case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing!

* 265: Pest Control ( Intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

  B: Yes! Thank goodness you're here. These bugs are driving us crazy!

  A: What sort of pest are we dealing with?

  B: We just bought this house and it is infected with just about
  everything. We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the
  place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!

  A: Well, there's nothing we can't handle. I'll spray the floorboards and
  walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to
  get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.
  Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the
  next three days.

  B: No problem, just get rid of the bugs!

* 266: Weather Report (Upper-Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A: Those are today's top stories. Now let's go to John for the weather.
  John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

  B: I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mark. There is a storm
  system moving through the East Coast. It will be drizzling all day
  today, and there's a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening. It
  will be warm and humid all weekend. In the Midwest, expect strong winds
  and a low of around 40 degrees.

  A: That's pretty chilly for the summer! Will it rain on Saturday?

  B: Unfortunately, yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there
  is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is
  a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast. Folks in
  those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that
  have been experiencing record high rainfalls.

  A: That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

  B: It gets better on Sunday, though. The storm systems move east and the
  skies will clear up at night. It will still be rather cool, with highs
  in the low 50s. The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually
  chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out. I advise weekend
  travelers to be careful, especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.

  A: Thanks John, and there you have it! Looks like it's a weekend to stay
  at home!

  A: Good Morning welcome to Bank of the USA. How may I help you today?

  B: Hi I need to transfer some money to another account. It's urgent.

  A: Okay, have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?

  B: No. I've never made a transfer before.

  A: It's alright, I will take you through the procedure. Are you
  transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

  B: A company account. I need to pay a bill.

  A: Okay, I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number
  as well as their bank's address and phone number.

  B: I have all the information in this folder.

  A: Well You've come prepared .You have all the necessary materials so we
  can go ahead and make the transfer right now. It's a simple transaction,
  and we can process it today.

  B: Oh, that's such a relief. I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

* 268: Purchasing Manager (Upper-Intermediate, The Office)

  A: Good morning, Angela, how have you been lately?

  B: Morning, Michael. I've been very busy lately. One of our other
  vendors is going out of business and I've been searching for a suitable
  replacement.

  A: Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long
  run sit down. Coffee?

  B: No, thanks. I've been trying to cut down on the caffeine .

  A: Haha, I could never do that. I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my
  morning coffee fix. Let's get down to business then.

  B: Yes. I've come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel
  cameras for our new MePhone. The demand for phone cameras is growing,
  and Pear has been falling behind in the market.

  A: That's great! I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the
  bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is
  Pear still interested in having those?

  B: No, we're changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were
  hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we
  could negotiate a better deal.

  A: Surely. Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

  <<section-0269.html>>

* 269: Marketing Plan (Upper-Intermediate, The Office)

  A: Okay everyone, let's begin. I called you here today to evaluate our
  marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our
  corporate mission of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and
  service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

  B: Several other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are
  drawing in more customers. Why aren't we doing the same thing?

  A: I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to
  reduce our prices to the level of our competitors. We offer a superior
  product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term
  sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

  B: Customers don't care about the coffee anymore. They only care about
  the price.

  A: I disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far
  better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean are
  artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our
  coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the
  taste test every time. We have never sought to appeal to the mass market
  with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.

  C: That's true. We've certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it
  comes to the best tasting brews and it's important to distinguish
  ourselves from our competitors. I think the main question is how we can
  show our appreciation to our customers.

  A: That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

  B: Money is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal
  customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning
  coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core
  competencies why don't we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at
  home.

  C: That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would
  we be undermining the essence of the company that way?

  A: Let's brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer
  always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets.
  Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

  Alpha computers.

  A: We have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch
  our new line of laptop and desktop computers.

  Manager for Alpha computers, who has flown in from California to give
  all of you an overview of the marketing campaign and to answer any
  questions you may have. So please give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford .

  B: Thank you Jonathan. It really is a pleasure to be here today. It has
  been three years since I visited Beijing ,and it's clear to me that
  operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

  B: The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and
  that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here. So
  congratulations to all of you.

  B: I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this
  afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.
  The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

  B: First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new
  x420 line; how the whole concept has come about and how the new product
  fits into our existing brand line.

  B: Secondly I'd like to present data on projected sales for the x420. We
  will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector. Then I would
  like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the x420.

  B: Finally I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or
  points you might have for me.

* 272: Getting A Nanny (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  Grace: Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today?

  Mel: Sorry, I can't! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from
  school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer
  practice and Maddie to dance class.

  Grace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you
  out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school
  activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some
  errands.

  Mel: Oh, I don't know... it's hard to find the right nanny .You have to
  consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give
  her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone
  to help me out, though.

  Grace: I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won't
  have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time
  with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She
  used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She's very
  responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

  Mel: Oh, that's great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I'll
  talk it over with Julian and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I
  won't be so tired every day, and Julian and I might even get to go on a
  date once in a while.

  Angela: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?

  Lydia: I'm looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very
  positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and
  that I will have a passionate summer fling!

  Angela: What are you talking about? Let me see that. . . What are
  horoscopes?

  Lydia: It's a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign . You
  have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was
  born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries. When were you born?

  Angela: January 5th.

  Lydia: Let's see. . . you're a Capricorn. It says that you will be
  feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in
  your love life . Looks like we'll both have interesting summers!

  Angela: That's bogus. I don't feel any stress at work, and my love life
  is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of
  nonsense.

  Lydia: No it's not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your
  personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to
  socialize.

  Angela: Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad
  they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?

  Lydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do
  things in conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds just like you!

* 274: Presentation Series 2 - Talking about numbers, charts and grap...

  Mr Ford: As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop
  computer sector is intense.

  Mr Ford: We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and
  this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as
  more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

  Mr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this market so cut-throat? Well
  the answer is simple. There is a huge untapped potential market out
  there ,with a huge untapped potential for profit.

  Mr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in
  terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

  Mr Ford: As you can see in the 1980's computer ownership amounted to
  around 0.5% of the total world population. Since the 1990's, computer
  ownership has risen dramatically.

  Mr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an even larger explosion in
  computer owners , with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an increase of
  1000 % percent compared with the 1980's .

  Mr Ford: If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically we
  can see in Chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands
  at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short
  time period.

  Mr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you
  compare the total population of China, and this is a key reason why the
  personal computer market is such a hot market.

  Mr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for all our competitors as well,
  we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the
  internet generation.

  Mr Ford: If we do this right we really can reap huge rewards in a very
  short time frame. I'd now like to move on to discuss the x420 brand
  itself, and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

  B: What are you getting?

  A: Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender. I decided to also
  get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

  B: Don't forget to also get a new mixer. I lent the old one to my
  brother and he broke it.

  A: Yeah I know. I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a
  new one. I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice
  steamed fish or veggies.

* 277：Presentation Series 3 -- Making Comparisons
  (Upper-Intermediate...

  Mr. Ford ：Now a key question you might ask yourself is what
  differentiates the new x420 line with our previous models, and also of
  course with some of our competitors.

  Mr. Ford ：In other words what makes the x420 stand out from all the
  others? This is a key question, and is something I'd like to explore in
  a little depth. Firstly, the x420 has a range of USPs that really make
  it a cut above the rest.

  Mr. Ford ：The first thing to mention is that the x420 is the first in a
  new generation of ultra-light laptop computers. It is only 2lbs, which
  compares very favorably with all our key competitors. In terms of
  computer performance, for such a light machine it's very powerful. 4GB
  of RAM, with an ultra-fast processor.

  Mr. Ford ：The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are
  installed with a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420 really
  stands out as next generation laptop. Compared with our previous x540
  range it really is in a league of its own..

  Mr. Ford ：Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the x420 we
  can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least 20
  million dollars. Now this is really a conservative estimate.

  Mr. Ford ：If our marketing campaign is successful I'm confident that we
  could see a doubling of this figure at the very least. Now please bear
  in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

  Mr. Ford ：I'm certain that in the coming three years the x420 will
  actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and
  revenue. Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and
  look more closely at our key competitors.

  city and 40 on the highway.

  A：That is really convenient. Especially now that fuel prices are so
  high! What's under the hood?

  B：A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, trust me, this car is
  fast!

  A：Now far the most difficult question. What is the price tag for this
  lovely vehicle?

  B：Very affordable man. You can take it out of this lot today with 0%
  down payment and no interest for the first year! You can test drive it
  now and we can sign the papers when we get back..

  A：Great! Let's do it!

  A: Hey man, you wanna buy some weed?

  B: Some what?

  A: Weed! You know? Pot, Ganja, Mary Jane some chronic!

  B: Oh, umm, no thanks.

  A: I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

  B: No, I am ok, really.

  A: Come on man! I even got dope and acid! Try some!

  A: I got my connections! Just tell me what you want and I'll even give
  you one ounce for free.

  B: Sounds good! Let's see, I want.

  A: Yeah?

  B: I want you to put your hands behind your head! You are under arrest!

* 280: Presentation Series 4 - Discussing the Competition (Upper-Inte...

  Mr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this cutting-edge technology there
  must be a catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail price will be
  too much for most consumers, you might say. Well, you'd be wrong!

  Mr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed at the luxury market, but if
  you compare the price of our leading competitors, the x420 represents
  incredible value for money. At only15,000RMB it is far more affordable
  and far more attractive than almost every leading brand and model.

  Mr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from our competitors? Well, if we
  compare Orange's luxury MP40 range then we can really highlight some of
  the differences.

  Mr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an enviable record for producing
  revolutionary and top class products, and I must admit the MP40 is a
  breathtaking machine. However, for most consumers the MP40 is simply far
  too expensive to consider.

  Mr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more expensive and there's no
  doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the
  x420 we really win hands down on value for money.

  Mr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after sales service we offer I think
  we can proudly boast the best customer service facilities in the whole
  lap-top sector. As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality,
  we guarantee service and we guarantee reliability.

  Mr. Ford: The questions we must ask ourselves are ” What does the Alpha
  brand stand for? and also ” How can we set ourselves apart from our
  competitors? The answer to both of these questions is the same my
  friends.

  Mr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence
  and for service. If we always stick to this philosophy then I'm
  confident that we will really be able to expand our market share
  significantly. Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our
  marketing campaign for the x420.

* 281: Breaking Up (Elementary, The Weekend)

  Lydia: Hello?

  Maggie: Hey! Do you want to go out tonight?

  Lydia: No, I think I'll pass. Mark broke up with me. I feel awful.

  Maggie: What?!? What happened? Just last week you were talking about
  going on vacation together!

  Lydia: I don't know what I did wrong. He said he needed some space to
  figure things out... He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a
  great person... just not the one for him...

  Maggie: Ugh! That's so cliché. Mark's not worth your time, Lydia. You
  deserve so much better!

  Lydia: I know we had hit a rough patch but I had hoped we could work it
  out next weekend, when we both had some time off... I think he found
  someone else. I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending
  a lot of time with a coworker...

  Maggie: Whatever. He's a jerk, forget about him! There are many more
  fish in the sea.

  Lydia: Talk about being cliché, Maggie! But you're right. There's no use
  for me to sulk around... Let's go out tonight!

* 282: Physics (Upper-Intermediate, Global View)

  Prof. Brown: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Physics 101. My name is
  Ed Brown, and I will be your professor for this semester. Since today is
  our first class, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course
  will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this
  semester.

  Matt: Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental
  physics, Professor? 

  Prof. Brown: This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a
  broad overview of the field of physics. The term “ physics” encompasses
  many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will
  provide you with conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove
  useful whether or not you choose to further your study in this field.

  Prof. Brown: We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental
  concepts of physics, then by the middle of the semester we will begin
  exploring the more theoretical side of physics. It is essential that you
  first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better
  understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them.

  Matt: Will we learn about black holes, wormholes, and string theory?

  Prof. Brown: We will learn about the general theory of relativity,
  including black holes. We will also explore developing theories in
  quantum mechanics, such as string theory. We will discuss some
  hypothetical features of space-time, like wormholes.

  Prof. Brown: We will also explore some of the more influential
  developments in the fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and
  nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern
  life. Now, I am going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this
  class, so you can see how this course will be graded.

  Matt: Oh man, looks like this isn't gonna be the easy A I thought it'd
  be!

* 283: Presentation Series 5 - Deferring Questions
  (Upper-Intermediate...

  Mr. Ford: Now, as we have already discussed there is a huge untapped
  market out there both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the
  more mature markets for us to push into. Now of course, this represents
  an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners, but for any
  new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

  Mr. Ford: It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer,
  and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level. The question we must
  first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly what
  do they expect from the next generation Alpha lap-top?

  Mr. Ford: Let's first of all tackle the first question. Our target
  consumer for the x420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an
  above average income. However, as we mentioned before the total number
  of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our
  audience for this product.

  Mr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also ideally suited to the younger
  student sector, who might use laptops both for study and gaming. There
  is no doubt that. 

  Audience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment. You say
  that the computer is suitable for students, but don't you think the
  price of the x420 is just too much for most students?

  Mr. Ford: Well, that's a fair point. If you don't mind I'd like to
  tackle your question a little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that
  okay?

  Audience Member: Yes sure.

  Mr. Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have an exciting campaign planned
  for the x420. Firstly, we will have a nationwide television campaign, as
  well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications. We
  also intend to.

  Audience Member: I'm sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think
  that a television campaign is cost effective. I mean, how much is that
  going to cost?

  Mr. Ford: Well I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to
  discuss those figures with you after the presentation. Okay let me just
  go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in
  store.

* 284: Tune Up ( Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A: Welcome to Al's Garage. What seems to be the problem?

  B: No problem at all! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make
  sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

  A: Very wise decision. When was the last time you had a tune up?

  B: Not that long ago, I think it was four months ago.

  A: We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand
  kilometers.

  B: Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check
  it so often?

  A: First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don't do
  this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would
  probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.

  B: I see. What else?

  A: We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels
  such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to
  determine when you will need new ones.

  B: Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of
  time and money.

  A: Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and
  avoid break downs.

* 285: Handyman (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A: The air conditioning is not working! We need to call a handyman
  before we start to fry in here!

  B: Dan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to
  fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

  A: That would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the
  electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.
  It's really annoying!

  B: Yeah you are right. This office is falling apart! Frank told me the
  other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the
  parking lot was flooded.

  A: I know! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day!
  The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

  Mr. Ford: The campaign that we have in store for the x420 is exciting,
  imaginative and revolutionary. We have spent two years listening to and
  responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

  Mr. Ford: I would like to say that without the assistance and support of
  each and every one of you we really could not have devised this
  campaign. I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the
  wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our
  marketing efforts, but also in your continuing your commitment to Alpha
  computers.

  Mr. Ford: There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce
  here and together we can really push Alpha computers to a whole new
  level of success.

  Mr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let me ask you all a question.
  How do we define the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability,
  quality, speed, reliability? What do you look for in a consumer? Well, I
  believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

  Mr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the x420
  is a state-of the- art laptop for all of your computing needs. With our
  television campaign we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

  Mr. Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned focusing on the fantastic
  USP' s of the x420. We have hired one of the best PR companies to work
  with us on the campaign, and have already completed three separate TV
  adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the x420.

  Mr. Ford: I'm excited to say that today, for the first time, we will
  unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements!

  catch up to see how they have been doing.

  A: Yeah I guess so. Oh look! There is Robert Matthews! Rob!

  C: Hey Bill! Wow great to see you!

  A: Likewise! It's been a long time! This is my wife Dorthy.

  C: Pleasure to meet you. So Bill, how have you been?

  A: Can't complain! We have 2 children who are in college and my business
  is going well. What about you?

  C: Ah you know me! I am a dedicated bachelor. I never married although I
  do have a beautiful daughter with Mary, you remember her? We were high
  school sweetheart, didn't really work out between us, but I really can't
  complain either.

  A: That's good. Have you seen Frank? I was hoping he would come tonight.

  C: You didn't hear? Frank passed away last year.

  A: Are you serious?

  C: Nah! I'm just yanking your chain. He'll be here soon. I saw him just
  last week and he told me he would show up.

* 288: Getting A Tattoo (Intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo.

  B: Really? Are you sure?

  A: Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon
  on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

  B: Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever!

  They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On
  top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!

  A: Really?

  B: Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin
  and inserts the ink.

  A: Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or
  something.

  B: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about
  tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure
  they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic.

  A: Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!

  Mr. Ford: Okay, so if we could dim the lights Jonathan, we can kick-off
  with the first TV advert. Please note that we are still in the early
  days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough round the edges.
  Okay, so. just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the
  screen...

  Mr. Ford: Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this. Bear with me a second. There seems
  to be a problem with the projector. Let me see. Jonathan, could you lend
  a hand a second?

  Jonathan: It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.
  Let me check the connection a second... Well the connection seems okay,
  and the computer is running normally.

  Mr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a problem with the system. Let's
  just reboot and start over. Let's see if this resolves the issue.

  Jonathan: Right, let's try again. No, still nothing Michael. There might
  be a technical issue with the projector. I think maybe the projector has
  overheated. We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start
  again. I'll call IT support to come over right now.

  Mr. Ford: Okay guys. Unfortunately technical problems do crop up from
  time to time, don't they? But it's not a huge problem. In the meantime
  while the IT guys get to work on that I can talk a little bit more about
  the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with
  this campaign.

  Shop assistant: Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can help you
  with today?

  Mark: umm... yeah! I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.
  Our fifth anniversary's next Friday.

  Shop assistant: Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the
  perfect gift for her. Is there anything in particular that you have in
  mind?

  Mark: No, not really... I'm completely at a loss.

  Shop assistant: Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this
  beautiful heart-shaped pendant. What is her favorite gemstone?

  Mark: That purple one. I'm sorry...I've never bought jewelery for anyone
  and I'm kind of nervous.

  Shop assistant: Don't worry, we specialize in providing our customers a
  relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment. That stone is an amethyst.
  We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces. Take a look at this
  bracelet. It's 18K rose-gold, studded with amethyst and blue topaz. It's
  a great statement piece.

  Mark: Oh...wow. That's really pretty. Jess would love that. But... I was
  thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

  Shop assistant: We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could
  also get her a locket. You could also get her a timepiece---it's both
  glamorous yet functional. If you tell me a little more about your
  girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

  Mark: Jess? Well, she's very smart, and has a great sense of humor.
  She's very feminine...

  Shop assistant: Perhaps you could give her a ring?

  Mark: Well...actually...I was thinking about asking Jess to marry
  me...I've just been so nervous.

  Shop assistant: Well sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great
  time to propose!

  Mark: Okay, I've decided. I'm going to pop the question!

  Shop assistant: Fabulous! We should look at engagement rings then! Now

  Manny: A Coke for me, please.

  Andrea: I'll have a Sprite.

  Waitress: Okay, I'll go get that for you. Are there any questions with
  the menu?

  Andrea: Do you use MSG?

  Waitress: No ma'am, we are MSG-free.

  Andrea: Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long! I want
  everything! This place has the BEST sesame chicken.

  Manny: Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time. I used to
  get take-out all the time. It's definitely been a while. Let's start off
  with some crab rangoon.

  Andrea: Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think I'm going to get the sesame
  chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

  Manny: It's so tempting to order everything on the menu, it all looks so
  appetizing! I think I'll get General Tso's chicken, hot and sour soup,
  fried wontons, and white rice.

  Andrea: Aren't you supposed to be on a diet? You should at least get
  brown rice.

  Manny: I don't think so! I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating
  healthy all the time. I've been eating so much salad I swear I've
  forgotten what meat tastes like! There's no better remedy than some
  nice, greasy, calorie laden Chinese food. I might even get an order of
  broccoli beef!

  Andrea: Gosh, I'm so hungry! Let's call the waitress over!

* 292: Presentation Series 8 - Common Presentation Mistakes (Upper-In...

  Mr. Ford: So as I mentioned previously the campaign advertisement will
  focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality
  laptop: affordability, quality, speed and reliability. We have pulled
  out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our
  competitors.

  Mr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point let me give you an
  anecdote here. I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our
  key suppliers. It was a lovely summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our
  supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to get his input on the new
  x420.

  Mr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of
  golf. It really is a wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I'm not that
  great at golf, but I have improved in the last few years. But the key to
  golf is practice, practice, practice. I've lost my thread. What was I
  talking about again?

  Jonathan: I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement
  Michael.

  Mr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I'm afraid I got sidetracked there. Yes
  anyway, the campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the projector working
  yet Jonathan?

  Jonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.

  Mr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm... all the information on the campaign is on the
  PowerPoint. I haven't actually got my notes with me...erm let me see,
  erm.....

  Audience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for
  the campaign? When are the first advertisements scheduled for?

  Mr. Ford: That's a good question. Unfortunately I erm...don't have that
  information on me. I will have to get back to you on that point.

  Jonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is fixed. I think we're ready.

  Mr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone, sorry for the delay. So without
  further ado the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy! oh ermmm. I'm
  terribly sorry, this is not the advert, this is my golfing holiday in
  Barbados. I think I must have brought the wrong file. Can we take five?

* 293: Cheese Lovers (Upper-Intermediate, Advanced Media)

  A: Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I want to welcome you to this
  course. We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious
  foods on this planet; cheese! Let's get started!

  A: Cheese is usually categorized into four types: soft, semi- soft
  semi-hard and hard. The designation refers to the amount of moisture in
  the cheese, which directly affects its texture. Making cheese is an
  ancient practice, dating back thousands of years, and the home cheese
  maker can usually find recipes for cheese that falls into any of the
  four categories.

  A: Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie,
  bleu, roquefort, mozzarella, muenster and similar cheeses. These cheeses
  generally pair well with fruit or meats, or can be used as breakfast
  cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings. They are usually mildly
  flavored and very high in moisture.

  A: American, Colby, co-jack and similar cheeses are in the semi-soft
  category. These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range
  of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of
  the most popular. This allows the sharper flavor of Colby to be combined
  with the milder jack cheese, and also melts better than plain Colby.
  Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses
  such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.

  A: Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and
  others. Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used
  to top spaghetti, but they are also used as accompaniments for fruit,
  wine, nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese
  and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.

* 294: Picking A University (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A: I've never heard of AmLion College. Could you...

  B: Of course sir, let me give you a brief overview. AmLion College is
  located in the center of New York city. The school covers a wide range
  of academic subjects; and eighty percent of the courses are transferable
  to other state universities. And, last year AmLion College was ranked
  number one in terms of graduate employment.

  A: Interesting, and what about the tuition fees, then?

  B: You'll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand US dollars per
  semester.

  A: Okay, well.

  B: And, did I mention our on-campus housing? Students can stay in our
  newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month!

  A: Sounds good. Well. I'll just grab one of your flyers.

  B: Sir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir, sir!

* 295: Presentation Series 9 - Summary and Conclusion (Upper-Intermed...

  Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I can't show you the
  marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the
  opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I have no doubt that you will
  be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key
  points.

  Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for
  Alpha computers. The recession is hopefully behind us. It is clear to
  everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in
  the developing markets.

  Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this ultracompetitive field then we
  really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet
  their needs on all levels. As I hope I have illustrated, the x420
  represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.

  Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in
  2010 with the new x420 range, and believe me, this is really just the
  beginning. Once we establish the x420 in the market we have plans to
  continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive
  products.

  Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I
  really see no limit to our potential as long as we stick to the
  principles I stressed earlier: quality, excellence and service.

  Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A section I'd really like to
  leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've
  discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same
  inspiration that it gives me.

  Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said ” Quality means doing it
  right, when no one is looking” Well, in fact our customers are looking;
  they are looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality
  that our competitors cannot. We cannot let them down.

  A: Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?

  B: Sure! What do you feel like having?

  A: I really feel like having a big juicy steak!

  B: Oh. ok. I don't eat meat, but that's fine, I am sure wherever we are
  going they will have other options right?

  A: I didn't know you were a vegetarian!

  B: I'm not, I am a vegan.

  A: A what?

  B: A vegan. I don't eat or use any animal based products. I don't wear
  leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. I
  used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat
  meat, but still have fish and seafood.

  A: Wow! That's interesting! It must be tough!

  B: It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants
  sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans
  nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

  May I take your order?

  B: Do you have any recommendations?

  A: Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce,
  but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

  B: Hmm. I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti
  instead of penne?

  A: Of course, mam. And for you?

  Jonathan: Well everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking
  Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks
  Michael.

  Jonathan: Now, I'm sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions,
  so I'd like to open it up a Q and A session. Please raise your hand if
  you have any questions at all. Janice, go ahead.

  Janice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the
  comment Mr. Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly
  Orange. Now as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market
  leader in the high-end lap-top market.

  Janice: How does Mr. Ford expect to compete with a company that has such
  a huge reputation and huge resources?

  Mr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question. I
  think you have hit the nail on the head actually. Orange are the global
  leaders precisely because of their size and power Mr. Ford: But,
  although we can't compete in terms of size I do believe we hold an
  advantage in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this
  is a David and Goliath battle, but don't forget who won that contest.

  Frank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you elaborate on the actual technical
  details of the x420 a little more?

  Mr. Ford: I'd love to but I think we are a little pressed for time right
  now. However Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the

* 299：Returning A Product (Elementary, Daily Life)

  A：Hi I would like to return this TV.

  B：Sure, do you have the receipt?

  A：Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to return this keyboard.

  B：Ok, may I ask what is the reason for returning these products?

  A：The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at time the
  image is not very clear.

  B：I see, and what about the keyboard?

  A：I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

  B：I am sorry man, but we can only exchange or refund defective
  products, we can not take responsibility for misuse or damages.

  A：Fine! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

* 300：Online Dating (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A：Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

  B：Oh, I can't. I have a date!

  A：Really? Wow with who?

  B：This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.
  She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

  A：Wait a minute, you mean you met her online?

  B：Yeah! I signed up for a website called match.com and it is great! You
  will fill in all your details and preference, like if you are a smoker
  or if you have any pets. Then you find people that have similar
  characteristics and you can email them or chat. 

  A：That is kind of weird! What if she is a psycho or something like
  that?

  B：It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! I am just
  tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! I think
  this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy. 

  A：I guess it does seem logical. I'll have to check it out!

* 301: Vampires (Intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: You want to go to the movies tonight?

  B: Sure! What's playing?

  A: The new Twilight movie!

  B: Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way I am watching that. I
  don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about
  vampires. It doesn't make sense.

  A: Of course it does. It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You
  have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they are so
  different. Add in the fact that immortality and super human strength is
  really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people
  that make the movie even more enticing.

  B: I don't buy into that. I think it's just a fad. Pretty soon this will
  pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies!

* 302: Phobias (Intermediate, Global View)

  A: Are you excited about your trip next month?

  B: Yes and no. I can't wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I am
  terrified.

  A: Why?

  B: Well, I have aerophobia. I have a chronic fear of flying.

  A: Oh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It's not
  that bad though, I mean, it is pretty scary to be in this big machine
  flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually have
  arachnophobia.

  B: You're scared of spiders? I actually have two more phobias.
  Acrophobia and glossophobia.

  A: I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, but public
  speaking is not that bad.

  B: Are you kidding? When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get
  really nervous and I can hardly speak.

  A: Well, I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic. I hate being in an
  elevator for more than 5 seconds.

  B: We are such weirdos right?

  A: Hello sir, welcome to Pistolera restaurant. May I take your order?

  beef burritos or cheese quesadillas? Both include a side of guacamole
  and jalapenos.

  B: Sure I'll have the burrito.. Do you have nachos?

  A: Of course sir. Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

  A: Ugg, this bathroom is a pigsty!

  B: Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet? What's wrong?

  A: I just can't stand it. It's really gross in here! There's a stain on
  the toilet seat, and the floor was wet and slippery. So I cleaned it!

  B: You did what? Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public
  washrooms that are much worse. Why are you cleaning the counter top? Are
  you out of your mind?

  A: I can't help myself; it's just so disgusting in here!

  B: Helen, this is not like your own bathroom. Just leave it to the
  cleaners, okay?

  A: Hang on. I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

  B: You're such a neat freak! I'm outta here!

* 305: Bowling (Intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: Alright, so the first thing that you need to know about bowling is
  that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.

  B: Why not?

  A: Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down. If you
  step there you will slip and fall.

  A: OK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard,
  so now, how the heck do I play this?

  A: You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.
  If you do, that is called a strike. If you don't knock them all down on
  the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare. After ten frames,
  we add up the points and see who has the most. Three hundred is a
  perfect score, but very hard to get.

  B: Got it! OK, I'm gonna give it a go. Oh no! My ball went in the
  gutter!

  A: I told you, its harder than you think. Now let a pro show you how
  it's done.

  <<section-0307.html>>

* 306: Pick Up Lines (Intermediate, The Weekend)

  A: Let's got out tomorrow night. We can go to a bar and try to find you
  a girlfriend.

  B: I don't think that's a good idea. I am just not good with approaching
  someone and starting up a conversation.

  A: Maybe you just need a few pick up lines, you know, break the ice.

  B: Pick up lines don't work!

  A: Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say: “If you were a
  booger I'd pick you first.”

  B: What? Come on! That's just lame! No girl would fall for that!

  A: Fine, then you can say: “So there you are! I've been looking all over
  for YOU, the woman of my dreams!”

  B: That's a good one! I think that's pretty funny.

  A: Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit
  and then you buy her a drink.

  B: Ok, how does this sound: “I was so enchanted by your beauty that I
  ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and
  number for insurance purposes.”

  A: Nice! Let's go!

  contacts but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

  Michelle: That's cool! How's it going?

  having a great time in Shanghai. It's really an amazing city.

  just call me. I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next
  week so if you want to drop by then.

  A: So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to?

  B: It's an Indian restaurant! I know you have never had Indian food, so
  I thought you might want to try.

  A: That sounds great! I am craving some type of beef dish.

  B: Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef. You see, cows are a
  sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion, so beef
  is not eaten.

  A: I see, so what are we having? Chicken?

  B: There are many amazing dishes to choose from. We can have some
  chicken tikka masalawhich is an amazing curry. It's a bit spicy, but I
  think you can handle it.

  A: Sounds good! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich
  flavor to food.

  B: Yeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori
  oven. Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to
  scoop up the curry or rice.

  A: What about veggies?

  B: They have a good variety of vegetable baseddishes like palak paneer,
  vegetable samosas or Daal.

  A: It all sounds exquisite! I can't wait!

  first time to Shanghai , Maria?

  Maria: No actually, I often visit. I usually come to China for business
  at least once a year. Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai, so
  that's a good reason to come.

  Michelle: Me too. Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I
  recommend. I mean, the food is delicious but the service isn't so good.
  I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue
  there.

  James: We should go together some time.

  Tracy: Okay, so. . . . . . . to Whom It May Concern, I am writing.

  Melanie: Um, Tracy? I think that's a little too formal. I know you want
  to be polite but you've already made contact with them, so in English
  you can be more relaxed in the opening. . . .

  Tracy: Okay, more relaxed. Got it. . . . Hey Sally, what's up? It's
  Tracy here, just.

  Melanie: Okay Tracy, now it's too relaxed! You've still got to show some
  respect. How about starting with “Dear Ms. Cooper, I'm writing to
  confirm. . . ?

  Tracy: Great, okay. “Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final
  quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested
  for the spring issue of Voila magazine.

  suggest you say, ” please note that final payment is due two working
  weeks before publication? You don't want to offend her.

  Tracy: Oops okay. You are right. Then I can just end with “All the best,
  Tracy”

  Melanie: Hmmmm, maybe, but I'd play it safe and just finish with “Yours
  Sincerely”. That's more professional.

* 317: First Paycheck (Advanced, The Office)

  Emily: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my
  paycheck.

  Susan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.

  Emily: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are
  a few things I don't understand. First off, what is this FICA, and SUI Y
  tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health
  insurance plan?

  Susan: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here
  represents your gross pay.

  Emily: Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

  Susan: Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the
  federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or
  something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's
  Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help
  you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.

  Emily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health
  insurance I can use now.

  Susan: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state
  deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI SDI tax you
  were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund
  that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity
  that they take.

  Emily: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there
  are two separate income taxes -- one at a state level and one at a
  federal level?

  Susan: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher
  property taxes or sales taxes instead.

  Emily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out
  on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty
  self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.

  Susan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay
  is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some
  explanation.

  Emily: Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much
  attention. See you later!

  Tom: Maybe we should put you into quarantine haha, jokes aside, I think

  to pollen though and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so
  many times, Hmm.. .

  Jim: Ow! Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

  Tom: Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts, I guess not.

  section. Not only does the test mark you on the number of questions
  answered but also on the difficulty.

  Ash: Okay this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for

  good!

  A：This is delicious! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice
  taste!

  tomato. 

  A：This is delicious! The combination of sour and spicy is really
  interesting! I could have this everyday!

  B：Ok, now for the last and best dish in my opinion. This is called Pad
  Thai. It's stir-fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red
  chili pepper plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu and garnished with
  crushed peanuts and coriander. It's practically Thailand's national
  dish!

  B: So confusing! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if
  we failed an exam we would got an F.

  A: Excuse me, can I try on this pair of jeans?

  B: Sure. Let me see...I'm afraid we don't have any size eights left.

  A: What are you talking about? I'm always a size four. Here, I'll try
  these.

  B: They seem a bit too tight. Shall I find you a larger size?

  A: No, they fit fine. They show off my curves perfectly!

  B: Yeah, your love handles. Yeah, they sure do, although...here, you
  forgot to close this button.

  Mr. Campbell：I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the
  conference. I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.

  B：You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo do you?

  A：Well I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their
  palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true!

  B：Of course it does! They tell you general and obvious things like that
  you will be successful or have a big house. I think most of the times
  they are just scam artists.

  A：Well historically it is a practice that many cultures share. Reading
  the tarot cards, in the east they would even read tea leaves! I even
  heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar, and then read
  your ashes.

  B：All superstitious nonsense! I would still like to go to one and see
  what he or she has to say, just for kicks.

  Melissa： Yes, he told me. We need to pick him up at his hotel and then

  wonderful.

  Michelle：That sounds so romantic! Jack and I were hoping to get married
  in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans. We just don't
  have the money!

  Melissa： I know what you mean. I think Shanghai is getting more and
  more expensive, don't you?

* 332：Setting Up Your Voice Mail Message (Elementary, Daily Life)

  A：Can you help me set up my voicemail message? I just got this service
  and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say.

  B：Sure! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called,
  and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

  A：Ok, so can I say, “This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later,
  so leave me your name and number.”

  B：That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more
  friendly.

  A：Ok, so how about this, “This is Abby and I am really happy you
  called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please
  leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon!”

  B：A little too friendly, Abby. Just say this, “Hi, you have reached
  Abby. I am unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me
  your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.
  Thanks”.

  A：That's perfect! Can you say that again and record it for me?

  A: That's right the brain! It serves as a control center for the body,
  handing the processes of the central nervous system as well as
  cognition. Then what major organ is in our chest?

  B: The heart!

  A: Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, using the circulatory
  system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let's not forget that our
  lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what
  about the organs that help us digest food?

  B: The stomach and intestines!

  A: Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks
  down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the
  waste. Are we forgetting anything?

  B: Yeah! Our kidneys, liver and bladder!

  A: Oh yes, you are right. Very important organs indeed.

  together, the went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to
  go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.

  A: Sounds like fun! When we go he always just likes to play in the

  heard Santa.

  A: Really? How to you know it was Santa?

  so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies. I even left out some
  milk. I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came
  downstairs!

  A: Hmm...well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you
  hiding behind the tree, spying on him!

  B: Really?

  A: Really! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed. That way, we can
  let Santa do his job. Then when you wake up, it will be Christmas
  already!

* 337：The Night Before Christmas (Upper-intermediate, Global View)

  Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a
  creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

  The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,

  In hopes that St. Nichoals soon would be there;

  The children were nestled all sung in their beds,

  And mama in her' kerchief, and I in my cap,

  Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,

  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

  I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

  Away to the window I flew like a flash,

  Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

  The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day
  to objects below,

  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,

  But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

  With a little old driver, so lively and quick,

  I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.

  More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

  And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;

  “Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!

  On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!

  To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!

  Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!

  As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

  When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,

  So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,

  With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.

  And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of
  each little hoof.

  As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

  Down the chimney St. Nicholas come with a bound.

  He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,

  And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;

  A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,

  And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

  His eyes-how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!

  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!

  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

  And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;

  The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

  And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;

  He had a broad face and a little round belly,

  That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.

  He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,

  And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;

  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,

  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

  And filled all the thestockings; then turned with a jerk,

  And laying his finger aside of his nose,

  And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;

  He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

  And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

  But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,

  “Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.”

* 338：Having Leftovers (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A：What's for dinner?

  B：Leftovers.

  A：What? Leftovers of what and from when?

  B：From last night! I took the left over turkey, mixed it with some
  dices peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some
  sandwiches!

  A：Isn't that dangerous though? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on
  food that was left out or reheated?

  B：Well, I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than
  an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating. Also, when
  reheating, I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred
  degrees Celsius.

  A：Well ok, I am just afraid of getting food poisoning.

  B：Don't worry about it! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an
  art! Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and
  have something different to eat!

  seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.

  B：Of course! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and
  also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

  A：Well Allen is a great student. He is a hard worker and very well
  behaved, however he does struggle a bit with math.

  B：I guess he gets that from me, I never did well in math when I was a
  kid. What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the
  classroom.

  A：Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework
  assignments and help him with math. I would also recommend he stay after
  school twice a week for tutoring sessions. It will really help a lot.

  B：Thanks a lot! I will definitely do that. Is there anything else?

  A：Um...yes. Here is a notice from our financial department, seems your
  child's tuition is overdue.

  B：Oh yes, I ...

* 340：Happy New Year! (Intermediate, Global View)

  A：It's almost midnight! We are about to start a brand new year!

  B：I know it's so exciting! A new year is always like a clean slate. A
  fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

  A：Do you have a New Year's resolution?

  B：I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my New Year's
  resolution. Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice.

  A：Yeah I know what you mean. That's why this year I am keeping things
  more simple. Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in
  a long time, or doing some volunteering work.

  B：That seems reasonable. We should get together and watch the ball drop
  in Times Square.

  A：Sure, as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight!

  B：Well, we can't break tradition! It's bad luck!

* 341：Baking A Cake ( Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A: Ok, so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?

  B: Almost, let me just put my apron on.

  A: Ok, so the first thing we are going to do is preheat the oven, that
  way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing
  everything. Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit.

  B: Got it.

  A: Now we are gonna make the batter. Take some butter and sugar and mix
  it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla
  extract and eggs and continue mixing.

  B: Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer?

  A: Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed. I'm gonna
  sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with
  milk and the rest of the ingredients.

  B: Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?

  A:Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when
  it bakes.

  B: Done. So how long do we bake it for?

  A: We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes. Then we let
  it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.

  B: Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!

  looking for a book.

  B：Yes I am. You can check our online catalog to search the book you
  want based on the genre, title or if you know the author, I can point
  you towards the right direction.

  A：I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.

  B：That would be in our children's section. That book shelf there on the
  right.

  A：Ok, I would like to check out these books.

  B：Do you have a library card?

  A：No. How do I get one?

  B：I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that
  you a resident of this state.

  A：Here you go.

  B：So you are all set. You can have these books for two weeks. If you
  need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them. If you
  don't, you get charged ten cents a day for each book.

  A：Ok, thanks!

  are gonna get in trouble!

  B：Actually I will! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets
  on my case if I don't go. I like it, because it makes me feel more
  obligated to go and get healthy.

  A：That's cool, does your personal trainer basically teach you how to
  work out?

  B：Yeah. He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work
  on, or the muscles I want to build. Like for example in order to get
  better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with
  free weights. Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lefts
  and squats.

  A：Sounds like you are really getting in shape!

* 346：All About Wines (Upper- Intermediate, Global View)

  A: Hello there, welcome to Wine World. Let me know if I can help you out
  at all.

  B: Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I'm going over to my
  boss' house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should
  bring.

  A: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?

  B: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.

  A: Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to
  pair with wine. Well, let's see, have to be a white wine, of course.

  B: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi?

  A: No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and
  red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has
  more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.

  B: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine,
  right?

  A: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best
  bet. Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites, and tends to be a
  bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this
  Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.

  B: Sauvignon Blanc? What's that?

  A: That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.

  B: Let's see. The label says it's got” attractive citrus and grassy
  aromas that give way of crisp, mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish.
  Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I'm on
  my way to the dinner now.

  A: It's OK, don't worry, we'll just choose a wine from the cooler. We
  don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but... this Rhone
  Valley white would be lovely.

  B: All right. What varietal is that?

  A: Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the
  varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown
  in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.
  This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly
  Viognier, I'd guess.

  B: And you think this is a good wine?

  A: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the
  Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more
  approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

  B: Perfect! I'll take it!

  A: Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?

  B: Yes. I have some travelers' cheques and two credit cards.

  A: You want to go get a facial with me today?

  B: Dude, what are you talking about? Only girls do that.

  A: Not at all, guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures. There is
  nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.

  B: True. So what do they do to you at your beauty spa?

  A: Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin.
  Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and
  young. Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling
  like a million bucks.

  B: That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in. In
  any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the
  day.

  A: Well you should come with me one day, I'm sure you'll love it.

  B: Uh...no.

* 349：Chinese Medicine (Upper-Intermediate, Global View)

  A：What's wrong?

  B：I have a headache. These past few days I've been living off
  painkillers. Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.

  A：You should get acupuncture treatment. My mom was always having
  headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.

  B：The results are too slow. On top of that, just the thought of smoking
  needles poking into my flesh frightens me.

  A：They don't just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points.
  The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment,
  restoring the body's “chi”.

  B：But I get scared the moment I see a needle. How could I stand having
  needles in my body for hours and end?

  A：The needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor's technique is
  good, and the patient himself is relaxed, it won't hurt-on the contrary
  it will actually alleviate pain. Now there are high-tech needles that
  micro thin; they don't hurt at all. However, if you are really scared of
  acupuncture, scraping and cupping are also options.

  B：Scraping is too terrifying. When they finish scrapping, your body is
  all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body
  ends up with red circles all over it-looks like someone beat you up.

  A：This only signifies that the toxins have left the body. Actually,
  there is only discomfort during the treatment process. Once it's over
  you feel very comfortable.

  B：Chinese medicine is strange. The patients are already ill, and then
  the doctor makes them suffer more.

  A：This is the only way to get at the problem. Anyway, if you want to
  relieve the pain, You are just going to have to be tough and do it.

  B：Forget it. I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself. In a
  little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.

  so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.

  B：What about Rubella and Mumps?

  A：Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks
  I can administer the rest.

  B：Ok great. Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster. Last
  time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!

  A：We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer the
  booster as well. Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight, this may sting a
  little.

* 352：The 7 Wonders Of The World (Intermediate, Global View)

  A：Have you seen this news article? Apparently an organization has made
  a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote
  for them online.

  B：Wow, that's really interesting. So who won?

  A：Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

  B：I've been there! It really is an amazing work of architecture and
  art. The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of
  the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds!

  A：Cool! Also amongst the winners is Petra, in Jordan, Machu Picchu in
  Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico.

  B：What a minute! It also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil
  and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders. I would love to go to Italy and
  see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator!

  A：Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go
  towards the end of the year.

  B：Good idea!

* 353：College Life (Intermediate, Global View)

  A：Hey, Jordan, is that you? Long time no see.

  B：Oh, hey, no kidding! I haven't seen you since orientation three
  months ago! So how've you been? Settling into college life OK?

  A：Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi lota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat
  house now.

  B：Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

  A：Yeah, yeah, I know, it's totally cliché, but really, I think it's
  been a good decision. I've got a lot of support and good suggestions
  from the guys. What about you? What have you been up to?

  B：Not much. I'm still living at home and commuting to school. I ended
  up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just
  wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. The guidance counselor suggested
  that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the
  credits count.

  A：That sounds smart...but kind of boring.

  B：Yeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors Club, though,
  which has been a lot of fun. We've gone on two camping trips already,
  and I've made some good friends A：That's cool. Hey, so have you decided
  on your major yet?

  B：Definitely pre-med. What about you?

  A：I still have no clue...but we don't have to declare a major ‘til our
  sophomore year, so I've got time! Oops, I'm late for class. Gotta run!

  B：OK, take care! Hey, nice running into you!

  A：Yeah, you too!

* 354：Homeschooling (Intermediate, Global View)

  A：I think we should home school our children when we decide to have
  kids.

  B：What? Why?

  A：Well, our public schools here are not very good and private school
  are just too expensive. I have been reading up on home schooling and it
  has a lot of advantages.

  B：Like what? I think that by doing something like that we would be
  isolating our children from social interaction.

  A：Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they
  learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having
  a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her
  strengths or weaknesses.

  B：I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

  A：I will bring it up over Sunday brunch.

  B：Good luck with that!.

  have to separate them into little piles.

  B：Ok, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels
  and pennies.

  A：Great, then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

  B：I found some coins that are not from here.

  A：Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London. I have a couple of
  different pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.

  address of where the party was and I never got your message.

  B：Why didn't you just call? I hate sending SMS messages.

  A：Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone. I used it all up
  this month.

  A：I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me

  robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

  B：What? That sounds really dodgy tome.

  A：No way, Tom is an honest person, he wouldn't lie tome.

  B：No I mean, it seems like someone may have backed his email account
  and sent that out．I mean think about it, why would he email you instead
  of calling you.

  A：Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending
  money?

  B：For sure! There are so many con artists out there, you never really
  know.

  <<section-0360.html>>

* 360：Urban Legends (Intermediate, Global View)

  A：Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the
  world?

  B：What do you mean?

  A：I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their
  hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold on the
  black market．

  B：Don't tell me you actually believe all that? Don't be so gullible,
  they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to
  scare you．

  A：Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal
  or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe
  that?

  B：You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the
  trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don't be so
  naive!

  A：Well maybe you are right, but how about the story of how KFC has rows
  of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger
  chickens faster!

  B：Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true don't you think?

* 361：Fast Food (Elementary, Daily Life)

  A：I'm hungry, let's order up something to eat.

  B：Ok, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down
  the street.

  A：I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae.

  B：You eat too much junk food. That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries
  and is very high in cholesterol.

  A：Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind.

  B：It's not only about getting fat or not, it's about being healthy. You
  could really have some health problems later on.

  some hot dogs!

* 362：What Mood Are You In? (Intermediate, Daily Life)

  A：Are you ok? You seem a bit anxious.

  B：Yeah I'm OK, I have been having a lot of mood swings lately. I think
  it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos
  on my hormones.

  A：So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?

  B：Yeah, it's weird. For example just this morning I was feeling
  detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that
  way.

  A：Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel
  confident, brave and hopeful!

  B：I hope you are right.

* 363：Living With Your Parents (Elementary, Daily Life)

  A：Why did your girlfriend break up with you ?

  B：I don't know, she said she was tired of me not manning up and being
  more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.

  A：Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.

  B：What do you mean? Lots of people live with their parents, especially
  when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.

  A：Yeah, but you are almost forty! Plus, you make good money so there is
  really no excuse．It's simply because you are a momma's boy.

  B：Whatever dude, I have everything I need, why would I move out! Have a
  great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me, what
  else could a guy ask for!

  A：Let's agree to disagree.

  B：Sure, what are you looking to buy or sell?

  A：Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.

  B：Oh, you want to get a maid?

  A：Well, I think it's better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic
  help.

  B：Ok, so what do you want her to do?

  A：Well, let's see. I want her to come in three times a week for a
  couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom and maybe do some
  cooking.

  B：Got it. And how much do you offer per month?

  A：I would pay her hourly, I don't know what the going rate is though.

  B：I know for sure it's more than minimum wage but maybe you should just
  negotiate with the person that answers the ad.

  A：Great! Thanks for you help!

  A：Kevin, what is this mess? It looks like a pigsty in here! Clean this
  up!

  B：Ok dad, I will do it in a minute, let me just finish this level of
  this game.

  A：No, I said now! Plus, you are grounded, you're not allowed to play
  video games. I want you to make your bed, do the laundry and then come
  down-stairs and sweep the floors.

  B：That's so unfair!

  A：You have to pull your weight around here young man. My house, my
  rules.

  B：But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furni-ture and vacuumed
  the rugs.

  A：That's great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.
