** Lesson 1 A private conversation
Why did the writer complain to the people behind him?
Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was
very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were
sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could
not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman
angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear
it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 'This is a
private conversation!'

** Lesson 2 Breakfast or lunch?
Why was the writer's aunt surprised?
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed
until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the
window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining
again.' Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. 'I've just
arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'
'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.
'What are you doing?' she asked.
'I'm having breakfast,' I repeated.
'Dear me,' she said. 'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'

** Lesson 3 Please send me a card
How many cards did the writer send?
Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I
visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a
few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I
did not understand a word. Everyday I thought about postcards. My
holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the
last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven
cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single
card!

** Lesson 4 An exciting trip
Why is Tim finding this trip exciting?
I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. He is in Australia.
He has been there for six months. Tim is an engineer. He is working for
a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places
in Australia. He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice
springs, a small town in the centre of Australia. He will soon visit
Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth. My brother has never been
abroad before, so he is fending this trip very exciting.

** Lesson 5 No wrong numbers
What does 'No wrong numbers' mean?
Mr.James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought
another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury,
but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just
bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message
from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in three
minutes. Up to now, Mr.Scott has sent a great many requests for spare
parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In this
way, he has begun his own private 'telephone' service.

** Lesson 6 Percy Buttons
.
Who is Percy Buttons?
I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar
knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In
return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs. I gave him
a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of
cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him.
Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house
in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of
beer.

** Lesson 7 Too late
Did the detectives save the diamonds?
The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all
morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South
Africa. A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves
would try to steal the diamonds. When the plane arrived, some of the
detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were
waiting on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and
carried it into the Customs House. While two detectives were keeping
guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their surprise, the
precious parcel was full of stones and sand!

** Lesson 8 The best and the worst
Why is Joe's garden the most beautiful one in the town?
Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody
enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Joe wins every
time. Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's. Bill works harder than
Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more
interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a
pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year I
enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize
for the worst garden in the town!

** Lesson 9 A cold welcome
What does 'a cold welcome' refer to?
On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall. It was the last day of
the year and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall
clock. It would strike twelve in twenty minutes' time. Fifteen minutes
passed and then, at five to twelve, the clock stopped. The big minute
hand did not move. We waited and waited, but nothing happened. Suddenly
someone shouted. 'It's two minutes past twelve! The clock has stopped!'
I looked at my watch. It was true. The big clock refused to welcome the
New Year. At that moment, everybody began to laugh and sing.

** Lesson 10 Not for jazz
What happened to the clavichord?
We have an old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was
made in Germany in 1681. Our clavichord is kept in the living room. It
has belonged to our family for a long time. The instrument was bought by
my grandfather many years ago. Recently it was damaged by a visitor. She
tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys too hard and two of the
strings were broken. My father was shocked. Now we are not allowed to
touch it. It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.

** Lesson 11 One good turn deserves another
Who paid for Tony's dinner?
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in. Tony
worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank.
He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and
never pays it back. Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table. He
has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating, I asked him to
lend me twenty pounds. To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately.
'I have never borrowed any money from you,' Tony said, 'so now you can
pay for my dinner!'

** Lesson 12 Goodbye and good luck
Where is Captain Alison going and how?
Our neighbour, Captain Charles Alison, will sail from Portsmouth
tomorrow. We'll meet him at the harbour early in the morning. He will be
in his small boat, Topsail. Topsail is a famous little boat. It has
sailed across the Atlantic many times. Captain Alison will set out at
eight o'clock, so we'll have plenty of time. We'll see his boat and then
we'll say goodbye to him. He will be away for two months. We are very
proud of him. He will take part in an important race across the
Atlantic.

** Lesson 13 The Greenwood Boys
Why will the police have a difficult time?
The Greenwood Boys are a group of pop singers. At present, they are
visiting all parts of the country. They will be arriving here tomorrow.
They will be coming by train and most of the young people in the town
will be meeting them at the station. Tomorrow evening they will be
singing at the Workers' Club. The Greenwood Boys will be staying for
five days. During this time, they will give five performances. As usual,
the police will have a difficult time. They will be trying to keep
order. It is always the same on these occasions.

** Lesson 14 Do you speak English?
Did the young man speak English?
I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village
in the south of France, I drove on to the next town. On the way, a young
man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had
got into the car, I said good morning to him in French and he replied in
the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at
all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the
town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, "Do you speak
English?' As I soon learnt, he was English himself!'

** Lesson 15 Good news
What was the good news?
The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very
nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk
when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very
bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large
salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.
'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice.
'Don't interrupt,' he said.
Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a
year!

** Lesson 16 A polite request
What was the polite request?
If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon
find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket.
However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very
polite. During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car: 'sir,
we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You will enjoy
your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is
only a reminder.' If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to
obey it!

** Lesson 17 Always young
First listen and then answer the question.
Why doesn't Aunt Jennifer tell anyone how old she is?
My aunt Jennifer is an actress. She must be at least thirty-five years
old. In spite of this, she often appears on the stage as a young girl.
Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time, she will
be a girl of seventeen. In the play, she must appear in a bright red
dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play, she had to
wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress. If anyone ever
asks her how old she is, she always answers, 'Darling, it must be
terrible to be grown up!'

** Lesson 18 He often does this!
First listen and then answer the question.
What had happened to the writer's bag?
After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag. I had left
it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there! As I was looking
for it, the landlord came in.
'Did you have a good meal?" he asked.
'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got
my bag.'
The landlord smiled and immediately went out. In a few minutes he
returned with my bag and gave it back to me.
'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken in into the garden. He
often does this!'

** Lesson 19 Sold out
First listen and then answer the question.
When will the writer see the play?
'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.
'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.
I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I
asked.
'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.
'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.
'Can I return these two tickets?' he asked.
'Certainly,' the girl said.
I went back to the ticket office at once.
'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.
'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's
performance. Do you still want them?'
'I might as well have them,' I said sadly.

** Lesson 20 One man in a boat
First listen and then answer the question.
Why is fishing the writer's favourite sport?
Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours without catching
anything. But this does not worry me. Some fishermen are unlucky.
Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even
less lucky. I never catch anything -- not even old boots. After having
spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag.
'You must give up fishing!' my friends say. 'It's a waste of time.' But
they don't realize one important thing. I'm not really interested in
fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at
all!

** Lesson 21 Mad or not?
First listen and then answer the question.
Why do people think the writer is mad?
Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near an airport and passing
planes can be heard night and day. The airport was built years ago, but
for some reason it could not be used then. Last year, however, it came
into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their
homes by the noise. I am one of the few people left. Sometimes I think
this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. I have been offered
a large sum of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here.
Everybody says I must be mad and they are probably right.

** Lesson 22 A glass envelope
First listen and then answer the question.
How did Jane receive a letter from a stranger?
My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of
her own age in Holland. Last year, we were travelling across the Channel
and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a
bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea. She never thought of it
again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in
Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. However, they
have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more,
but they will certainly travel faster.

** Lesson 23 A new house
First listen and then answer the question.
Why is the new house special?
I had a letter from my sister yesterday. She lives in Nigeria. In her
letter, she said that she would come to England next year. If she comes,
she will get a surprise. We are now living in a beautiful new house in
the country. Work on it had begun before my sister left. The house was
completed five months ago. In my letter, I told her that she could stay
with us. The house has many large rooms and there is a lovely garden. It
is a very modern house, so it looks strange to some people. It must be
the only modern house in the district.

** Lesson 24 If could be worse
First listen and then answer the question.
Had the writer's money been stolen?
I entered the hotel manager's office and sat down. I had just lost $50
and I felt very upset. 'I left the money in my room,' I said, 'and it's
not there now.' The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing.
'Everyone's losing money these days,' he said. He started to complain
about this wicked world but was interrupted by a knock at the door. A
girl came in and put an envelope on his desk. It contained $50. 'I found
this outside this gentleman's room,' she said. 'Well,' I said to the
manager, 'there is still some honesty in this world!'

** Lesson 25 Do the English speak English?
First listen and then answer the question.
Why does the writer not understand the porter?
I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and
dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter. I not
only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter,
however, could not understand me. I repeated my question several times
and at last he understood. he answered me, but he spoke neither slowly
nor clearly. 'I am a foreigner,' I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I
could not understand him. My teacher never spoke English like that! The
porter and I looked at each other and smiled. Then he said something and
I understood it. 'You'll soon learn English!' he said. I wonder. In
England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand
each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?

** Lesson 26 The best art critics
First listen and then answer the question.
Who is the student's best critic?
I am an art student and I paint a lot of pictures. Many people pretend
that they understand modern art. They always tell you what a picture is
'about'. Of course, many pictures are not 'about' anything. They are
just pretty patterns. We like them in the same way that we like pretty
curtain material. I think that young children often appreciate modern
pictures better than anyone else. They notice more. My sister is only
seven, but she always tells me whether my pictures are good or not. She
came into my room yesterday.
'What are you doing?' she asked.
'I'm hanging this picture on the wall,' I answered. 'It's a new one. Do
you like it?'
She looked at it critically for a moment. 'It's all right,' she said,
'but isn't it upside down?'
I looked at it again. She was right! It was!

First listen and then answer the question.
What happened to the boys in the night?
Late in the afternoon, the boys put up their tent in the middle of a
field. As soon as this was done, they cooked a meal over an open fire.
They were all hungry and the food smelled good. After a wonderful meal,
they told stories and sang songs by the campfire. But some time later it
began to rain. The boys felt tired so they put out the fire and crept
into their tent. Their sleeping bags were warm and comfortable, so they
all slept soundly. In the middle of the night, two boys woke up and
began shouting. The tent was full of water! They all leapt out of their
sleeping bags and hurried outside. It was raining heavily and they found
that a stream had formed in the field. The stream wound its way across
the field and then flowed right under their tent!

First listen and then answer the question.
What is Jasper White's problem?
Jasper White is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths.
he has just bought a new house in the city, but ever since he moved in,
he has had trouble with cars and their owners. When he returns home at
night, he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate.
Because of this, he has not been able to get his own car into his garage
even once. Jasper has put up 'No Parking' signs outside his gate, but
these have not had any effect. Now he has put an ugly stone head over
the gate. It is one of the ugliest faces I have ever seen. I asked him
what it was and he told me that it was Medusa, the Gorgon. jasper hopes
that she will turn cars and their owners to stone. But none of them has
been turned to stone yet!

** Lesson 29 Taxi!
First listen and then answer the question.
Does Captain Fawcett think any trip is too dangerous?
Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new
service. The 'taxi' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Pilatus
Porter'. This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers. The most
surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on
snow, water, or even on a ploughed field. Captain Fawcett's first
passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in
the Welsh mountains. Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to
many unusual places. Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and
on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park. Captain Fawcett
has just refused a strange request from a businessman. The man wanted to
fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean, but Captain
Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous.

What happened to the man in the boat?
The Wayle is a small river that cuts across the park near my home. I
like sitting by the Wayle on fine afternoons. It was warm last Sunday,
so I went and sat on the river bank as usual. Some children were playing
games on the bank and there were some people rowing on the river.
Suddenly, one of the children kicked a ball very hard and it went
towards a passing boat. Some people on the bank called out to the man in
the boat, but he did not hear them. The ball struck him so hard that he
nearly fell into the water. I turned to look at the children, but there
weren't any in sight: they had all run away! The man laughed when he
realized what had happened. He called out to the children and threw the
ball back to the bank.

First listen and then answer the question.
What was Frank's first job?
Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his experiences
as a young man. Before he retired, Frank was the head of a very large
business company, but as a boy he used to work in a small shop. It was
his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen
hours a day. He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small
workshop of his own. In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for
aeroplanes. At that time he had two helpers. In a few years the small
workshop had become a large factory which employed seven hundred and
twenty-eight people. Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early
years and the long road to success. He was still smiling when the door
opened and his wife came in. She wanted him to repair their grandson's
bicycle!

** Lesson 32 Shopping made easy
First listen and then answer the question.
Who was the thief?
People are not so honest as they once were. The temptation to steal is
greater than ever before -- especially in large shops. A detective
recently watched a well-dressed woman who always went into a large store
on Monday mornings. One Monday, there were fewer people in the shop than
usual when the woman came in, so it was easier for the detective to
watch her. The woman first bought a few small articles. After a little
time, she chose one of the most expensive dresses in the shop and handed
it to an assistant who wrapped it up for her as quickly as possible.
Then the woman simply took the parcel and walked out of the shop without
paying. When she was arrested, the detective found out that the shop
assistant was her daughter. The girl 'gave' her mother a free dress once
a week!

** Lesson 33 Out of the darkness
Why was the girl in hospital?
Nearly a week passed before the girl was able to explain what had
happened to her. One afternoon she set out from the coast in a small
boat and was caught in a storm. Towards evening, the boat struck a rock
and the girl jumped into the sea. Then she swam to the shore after
spending the whole night in the water. During that time she covered a
distance of eight miles. Early next morning, she saw a light ahead. She
knew she was near the shore because the light was high up on the cliffs.
On arriving at the shore, the girl struggled up the cliff towards the
light she had seen. That was all she remembered. When she woke up a day
later, she found herself in hospital.

** Lesson 34 Quick work
How long had the police taken to find his bicycle?
Dan Robinson has been worried all week. Last Tuesday he received a
letter from the local police. In the letter he was asked to call at the
station. Dan wondered why he was wanted by the police, but he went to
the station yesterday and now he is not worried anymore. At the station,
he was told by a smiling policeman that his bicycle had been found. Five
days ago, the policeman told him, the bicycle was picked up in a small
village four hundred miles away. It is now being sent to his home by
train. Dan was most surprised when he heard the news. He was amused too,
because he never expected the bicycle to be found. It was stolen twenty
years ago when Dan was a boy of fifteen!

** Lesson 35 Stop thief!
How did Roy stop the thieves?
Roy Trenton used to drive a taxi. A short while ago, however, he became
a bus driver and he has not regretted it. He is finding his new work far
more exciting. When he was driving along Catford Street recently, he saw
two thieves rush out of a shop and run towards a waiting car. One of
them was carrying a bag full of money. Roy acted quickly and drove the
bus straight at the thieves. The one with the money got such a fright
that he dropped the bag. As the thieves were trying to get away in their
car, Roy drove his bus into the back of it. While the battered car was
moving away, Roy stopped his bus and telephoned the police. The thieves'
car was badly damaged and easy to recognize. Shortly afterwards, the
police stopped the car and both men were arrested.

** Lesson 36 Across the Channel
What is Debbie going to try to do?
Debbie Hart is going to swim across the English Channel tomorrow. She is
going to set out from the French coast at five o'clock in the morning.
Debbie is only eleven years old and she hopes to set up a new world
record. She is a strong swimmer and many people feel that she is sure to
succeed. Debbie's father will set out with her in a small boat. Mr. Hart
has trained his daughter for years. Tomorrow he will be watching her

** Lesson 37 The Olympic Games
When was the last time this country hosted the Olympic Games?
The Olympic Games will be held in our country in four years' time. As a
great many people will be visiting the country, the government will be
building new hotels, an immense stadium, and a new Olympic-standard
swimming pool. They will also be building new roads and a special
railway line. The Games will be held just outside the capital and the
whole area will be called 'Olympic City'. Workers will have completed
the new roads by the end of this year. By the end of next year, they
will have finished work on the new stadium. The fantastic modern
buildings have been designed by Kurt Gunter. Everybody will be watching
anxiously as the new buildings go up. We are all very excited and are
looking forward to the Olympic Games because they have never been held
before in this country.

** Lesson 38 Everything except the weather
Why did Harrison sell his house so quickly?
My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years
before he returned to England. He had often dreamed of retiring in
England and had planned to settle down in the country. He had no sooner
returned than he bought a house and went to live there. Almost
immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it
was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold.
After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock. He acted as if he
had never lived in England before. In the end, it was more than he could
bear. He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and
left the country. The dream he had had for so many years ended there.
Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.

Why did Mr. Gilbert telephone Dr. Millington?
While John Gilbert was in hospital, he asked his doctor to tell him
whether his operation had been successful, but the doctor refused to do
so. The following day, the patient asked for a bedside telephone. When
he was alone, he telephoned the hospital exchange and asked for Doctor
Millington. When the doctor answered the phone, Mr. Gilbert said he was
inquiring about a certain patient, a Mr. John Gilbert. He asked if Mr.
Gilbert's operation had been successful and the doctor told him that it
had been. He then asked when Mr. Gilbert would be allowed to go home and
the doctor told him that he would have to stay in hosptial for another
two weeks. Then Dr. Millington asked the caller if he was a relative of
the patient. 'No,' the patient answered, 'I am Mr. John Gilbert.'

Was Mrs. Rumbold a good companion at dinner?
Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs.
Rumbold. Mrs. Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black
dress. She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her. Her eyes
were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating. I
tried to make conversation.
'A new play is coming to "The Globe" soon,' I said. 'Will you be seeing
it?'
'No,' she answered.
'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.
'No,' she answered.
'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.
'No,' she answered.
In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.
'Young man,' she answered, 'if you ate more and talked less, we would
both enjoy our dinner!"

What kind of shopping does the writer enjoy, do you think?
'Do you call that a hat?' I said to my wife.
'You needn't be so rude about it,' my wife answered as she looked at
herself in the mirror.
I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited. We
had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front
of the mirror.
'We mustn't buy things we don't need,' I remarked suddenly. I regretted
saying it almost at once.
'You needn't have said that,' my wife answered. 'I needn't remind you of
that terrible tie you bought yesterday.'
'I find it beautiful,' I said. 'A man can never have too many ties.'
'And a woman can't have too many hats,' she answered.
Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together. My wife was
wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse!

** Lesson 42 Not very musical
What happened when the snake charmer began to play jazz?
As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi, we
stopped at a square to have a rest. After a time, we noticed a snake
charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we
went to have a look at him. As soon as he saw us, he picked up a long
pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets. When he
began to play a tune, we had our first glimpse of the snake. It rose out
of the basket and began to follow the movements of the pipe. We were
very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz
and modern pop songs. The snake, however, continued to 'dance' slowly.
It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and
jazz!

How was the plane able to clear the mountains?
In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole, the American
explorer, R.E. Byrd, successfully flew over the South Pole for the first
time. Though, at first, Byrd and his men were able to take a great many
photographs of the mountains that lay below, they soon ran into serious
trouble. At one point, it seemed certain that their plane would crash.
It could only get over the mountains if it rose to 10,000 feet. Byrd at
once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks. The plane was
then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet. Byrd now
knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles
away, for there were no more mountains in sight. The aircraft was able
to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.

How did Mrs. Sterling get her bag back?
Mrs. Anne Sterling did not think of the risk she was taking when she ran
through a forest after two men. They had rushed up to her while she was
having a picnic at the edge of a forest with her children and tried to
steal her handbag. In the struggle, the strap broke and, with the bag in
their possession, both men started running through the trees. Mrs.
Sterling got so angry that she ran after them. She was soon out of
breath, but she continued to run. When she caught up with them, she saw
that they had sat down and were going through the contents of the bag,
so she ran straight at them. The men got such a fright that they dropped
the bag and ran away. 'The strap needs mending,' said Mrs. Sterling
later, 'but they did not steal anything.'

How did Sam get his money back?
The whole village soon learnt that a large sum of money had been lost.
Sam Benton, the local butcher, had lost his wallet while taking his
savings to the post office. Sam was sure that the wallet must have been
found by one of the villagers, but it was not returned to him. Three
months passed, and then one morning, Sam found his wallet outside his
front door. It had been wrapped up in newspaper and it contained half
the money he had lost, together with a note which said: 'A thief, yes,
but only 50 per cent a thief!' Two months later, some more money was
sent to Sam with another note: 'Only 25 per cent a thief now!' In time,
all Sam's money was paid back in this way. The last note said: 'I am 100
per cent honest now!'

When a plane from London arrived at Sydney airport, workers began to
unload a number of wooden boxes which contained clothing. No one could
account for the fact that one of the boxes was extremely heavy. It
suddenly occurred to one of the workers to open up the box. He was
astonished at what he found. A man was lying in the box on top of a pile
of woolen goods. He was so surprised at being discovered that he did not
even try to run away. After he was arrested, the man admitted hiding in
the box before the plane left London. He had had a long and
uncomfortable trip, for he had been confined to the wooden box for over
eighteen hours. The man was ordered to pay $3,500 for the cost of the
trip. The normal price of a ticket is $2,000!

A public house which was recently bought by Mr.Ian Thompson is up for
sale. Mr.Thompson is going to sell it because it is haunted. He told me
that he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise
coming from the bar. The next morning, he found that the doors had been
blocked by chairs and the furniture had been moved. Though Mr.Thompson
had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the
morning. He also said that he had found five empty whisky bottles which
the ghost must have drunk the night before. When I suggested that some
villagers must have come in for a free drink, Mr.Thompson shook his
head. The villagers have told him that they will not accept the pub even
if he gives it away.

Why did the writer become very worried?
Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer.
My dentist had just pulled out one of my teeth and had told me to rest
for a while. I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton
wool. He knew I collected match boxes and asked me whether my collection
was growing. He then asked me how my brother was and whether I liked my
new job in London. In answer to these questions I either nodded or made
strange noises. Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole
where the tooth had been. I suddenly felt very worried, but could not
say anything. When the dentist at last removed the cotton wool from my
mouth, I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.

How did the dream end?
Tired of sleeping on the floor, a young man in Teheran saved up for
years to buy a real bed. For the first time in his life, he became the
proud owner of a bed which had springs and a mattress. Because the
weather was very hot, he carried the bed on to the roof of his house. He
slept very well for the first two nights, but on the third night, a
storm blew up. A gust of wind swept the bed off the roof and sent it
crashing into the courtyard below. The young man did not wake up until
the bed had struck the ground. Although the bed was smashed to pieces,
the man was miraculously unhurt. When he woke up, he was still on the
mattress. Glancing at the bits of wood and metal that lay around him,
the man sadly picked up the mattress and carried it into his house.
After he had put it on the floor, he promptly went to sleep again.

I went on an excursion recently, but my trip took me longer than I
expected.
'I'm going to Woodford Green,' I said to the conductor as I got on the
bus, 'but I don't know where it is.'
'I'll tell you where to get off.' answered the conductor.
I sat in the front of the bus to get a good view of the countryside.
After some time, the bus stopped. Looking round, I realized with a shock
that I was the only passenger left on the bus.
'You'll have to get off here,' the conductor said. 'This is as far as we
go.'
'Is this Woodford Green?' I asked.
'Oh dear,' said the conductor suddenly. 'I forgot to put you off.'
'It doesn't matter,' I said. 'I'll get off here.'
'We're going back now,' said the conductor.
'Well, in that case, I prefer to stay on the bus,' I answered.

Why did Hugh's diet not work?
My friend, Hugh, has always been fat, but things got so bad recently
that he decided to go on a diet. He began his diet a week ago. First of
all, he wrote out a long list of all the foods which were forbidden. The
list included most of the things Hugh loves: butter, potatoes, rice,
beer, milk, chocolate; and sweets. Yesterday I paid him a visit. I rang
the bell and was not surprised to see that Hugh was still as fat as
ever. He led me into his room and hurriedly hid a large parcel under his
desk. It was obvious that he was very embarrassed. When I asked him what
he was doing, he smiled guiltily and then put the parcel on the desk. He
explained that his diet was so strict that he had to reward himself
occasionally. Then he showed me the contents of the parcel. It contained
five large bars of chocolate and three bags of sweets!

We have just moved into a new house and I have been working hard all
morning. I have been trying to get my new room in order. This has not
been easy because I own over a thousand books. To make matters worse,
the room is rather small, so I have temporarily put my books on the
floor. At the moment, they cover every inch of floor space and I
actually have to walk on them to get in or out of the room. A short
while ago, my sister helped me to carry one of my old bookcases up the
stairs. She went into my room and got a big surprise when she saw all
those books on the floor. 'This is the prettiest carpet I have ever
seen,' she said. She gazed at it for some time then added, 'You don't
need bookcases at all. You can sit here in your spare time and read the
carpet!'

What caused the fire?
At last firemen have put out a big forest fire in California. Since
then, they have been trying to find out how the fire began. Forest fires
are often caused by broken glass or by cigarette ends which people
carelessly throw away. Yesterday the firemen examined the ground
carefully, but were not able to find any broken glass. They were also
quite sure that a cigarette end did not start the fire. This morning,
however, a firemen accidentally discovered the cause. He noticed the
remains of a snake which was wound round the electric wires of a
16,000-volt power line. In this way, he was able to solve the mystery.
The explanation was simple but very unusual. A bird had snatched up the
snake from the ground and then dropped it on to the wires. The snake
then wound itself round the wires. When it did so, it sent sparks down
to the ground and these immediately started a fire.

After breakfast, I sent the children to school and then I went to the

school, my husband was at work and the house was quiet. So I decided to
make some meat pies. In a short time I was busy mixing butter and flour
and my hands were soon covered with sticky pastry. At exactly that
moment, the telephone rang. Nothing could have been more annoying. I
picked up the receiver between two sticky fingers and was dismayed when
I recognized the voice of Helen Bates. It took me ten minutes to
persuade her to ring back later. At last I hung up the receiver. What a
mess! There was pastry on my fingers, on the telephone, and on the
doorknobs. I had no sooner got back to the kitchen than the doorbell
rang loud enough to wake the dead. This time it was the postman and he
wanted me to sign for a registered letter!

** Lesson 55 Not a gold mine
What did the team find?
Dreams of finding lost treasure almost came true recently. A new machine
called 'The Revealer' has been invented and it has been used to detect
gold which has been buried in the ground. The machine was used in a cave
near the seashore where -- it is said -- pirates used to hide gold. The
pirates would often bury gold in the cave and then fail to collect it.
Armed with the new machine, a search party went into the cave hoping to
find buried treasure. The leader of the party was examining the soil
near the entrance to the cave when the machine showed that there was
gold under the ground. Very excited, the party dug a hole two feel deep.
They finally found a small gold coin which was almost worthless. The
party then searched the whole cave thoroughly but did not find anything
except an empty tin trunk. In spite of this, many people are confident
that 'The Revealer' may reveal something of value fairly soon.

How fast did the winning car go?
Once a year, a race is held for old cars. A lot of cars entered for this
race last year and there was a great deal of excitement just before it
began. One of the most handsome cars was a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. The
most unusual car was a Benz which had only three wheels. Built in 1885,
it was the oldest car taking part. After a great many loud explosions,
the race began. Many of the cars broke down on the course and some
drivers spent more time under their cars than in them! A few cars,
however, completed the race. The winning car reached a speed of forty
miles an hour -- much faster than any of its rivals. It sped downhill at
the end of the race and its driver had a lot of trouble trying to stop
it. The race gave everyone a great deal of pleasure. It was very
different from modern car races but no less exciting.

A woman in jeans stood at the window of an expensive shop. Though she
hesitated for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress
that was in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the
way she was dressed. Glancing at her scornfully, he told her that the
dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to
punish the assistant next day. She returned to the shop the following
morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long
umbrella in the other. After seeking out the rude assistant, she asked
for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager
to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop
window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did
not like it. She enjoyed herself making the assistant bring almost
everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first

Why does the vicar refuse to cut down the tree?
The tiny village of Frinley is said to possess a 'cursed tree'. Because
the tree was mentioned in a newspaper, the number of visitors to Frinley
has now increased. The tree was planted near the church fifty years ago,
but it is only in recent years that it has gained an evil reputation. It
is said that if anyone touches the tree, he will have bad luck; if he
picks a leaf, he will die. Many villagers believe that the tree has
already claimed a number of victims. The vicar has been asked to have
the tree cut down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that
the tree cut down, but so far he has refused. He has pointed out that
the tree is a useful source of income, as tourists have been coming from
all parts of the country to see it. In spite of all that has been said,
the tourists have been picking leaves and cutting their names on the
tree-trunk. So far, not one of them has been struck down by sudden
death!

** Lesson 59 In or out?
Why did Rex run away?
Our dog, Rex, used to sit outside our front gate and dark. Every time he
wanted to come into the garden he would bark until someone opened the
gate. As the neighbours complained of the noise, my husband spent weeks
training him to press his paw on the latch to let himself in. Rex soon
became an expert at opening the gate. However, when I was going out
shopping last week, I noticed him in the garden near the gate. This time
he was barking so that someone would let him out! Since then, he has
developed another bad habit. As soon as he opens the gate from the
outside, he comes into the garden and waits until the gate shuts. Then
he sits and barks until someone lets him out. After this he immediately
lets himself in and begins barking again. Yesterday my husband removed
the gate and Rex got so annoyed we have not seen him since.

given her some money, she looked into a crystal ball and said: 'A
relation of yours is coming to see you. She will be arriving this
evening and intends to stay for a few days. The moment you leave this
tent, you will get a big surprise. A woman you know well will rush
towards you. She will speak to you and then she will lead you away from
this place. That is all.'
As soon as I went outside, I forgot all about Madam Bellinsky because my
wife hurried towards me. 'Where have you been hiding?' she asked
impatiently. 'Your sister will be here in less than an hour and we must
be at the station to meet her. We are late already.' As she walked away,
I followed her out of the fair.

What is the special importance of a telescope in space?
The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20,1990 at
a cost of over a billion dollars. Right from the start there was trouble
with the Hubble. The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because
its main mirror was faulty! NASA is now going to put the telescope
right, so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it. The
shuttle Endeavour will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble. A
robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while
the astronauts make the necessary repairs. Of course, the Hubble is
above the earth's atmosphere, so it will soon be sending us the clearest
pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen. The
Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe.
By the time you read this, the Hubble's eagle eye will have sent us
thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.

** Lesson 62 After the fire
What was the danger to the villages after the fire?
Firemen had been fighting the forest for nearly three weeks before they
could get it under control. A short time before, great trees had covered
the countryside for miles around. Now, smoke still rose up from the warm
ground over the desolate hills. Winter was coming on and the hills
threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, for heavy rain
would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as
well. When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities
ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow
quickly. The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by
aeroplanes. The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it
began to rain. By then, however, in many places the grass had already
taken root. In place of the great trees which had been growing there for
centuries patches of green had begun to appear in the blackened soil.

Why was the first tunnel not completed?
In 1858, a French engineer, Aime Thome de Gamond, arrived in England
with a plan for a twenty-one-mile tunnel under the English Channel. He
said that it would be possible to build a platform in the centre of the
Channel. This platform would serve as a port and a railway station. The
tunnel would be well-ventilated if tall chimneys were built above sea
level. In 1860, a better plan was put forward by an Englishman, William
Low. He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built. This
would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this
tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it. Forty-two years later a
tunnel was actually begun. If, at the time, the British had not feared
invasion, it would have been completed. The world had to wait almost
another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel. It was officially opened on
March 7,1994, finally connecting Britain to the European continent.

** Lesson 65 Jumbo versus the police
Why did the police have to push Jumbo off the main street?
Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some
presents to a children's hospital. Dressed up as Father Christmas and
accompanied by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls, he set off down
the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo. He
should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing.
A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a
side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic. Though Jimmy agreed to
go at once, Jumbo refused to move. Fifteen policemen had to push very
hard to get him off the main street. The police had a difficult time,
but they were most amused. 'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a
policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry
him. Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we
shall let him off this time.'

** Lesson 66 Sweet as honey!
What was 'sweet as honey' and why?
In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island, a remote place in
the South Pacific, a long way west of Samoa. The plane wasn't too badly
damaged, but over the years, the crash was forgotten and the wreck
remained undisturbed. Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash,
the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the
island. By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was
rare and worth rescuing. The French authorities had the plane packaged
and moved in parts back to France. Now a group of enthusiasts are going
to have the plane restored. It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, but
the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt. Imagine their
surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases and found
that the fourth engine was sweet as honey -- still in perfect condition.
A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally
preserved in beeswax!

** Lesson 67 Volcanoes
Why does Tazieff risk his life like this?
Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist, has spent his lifetime studying
active volcanoes and deep caves in all parts of the world. In 1948, he
went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later
named Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the
volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he managed to take a
number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for
very long. He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards
him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to
escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was
able to return two days later. This time, he managed to climb into the
mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure
temperatures. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been
able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.

** Lesson 68 Persistent
Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist?
I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came
running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so
I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything
to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you.
I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all
morning.
'Hello, Nigel,' I said. 'Fancy meeting you here!'
'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered. 'I was just wondering how to spend the
morning -- until I saw you. You're not busy doing anything, are you?'
'No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to...'
'Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished
speaking.
'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'
'Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read
in the waiting room!

** Lesson 69 But not murder!
Do you think that the writer passed his driving test? Why?
I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time. I had been
asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully. After
having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire
confidence. Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my
test. The examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he
smiled and said. 'Just one more thing, Mr.Eames. Let us suppose that a
child suddenly crosses the road in front of you. As soon as I tap on the
window, you must stop within five feet.' I continued driving and after
some time, the examiner tapped loudly, Though the sound could be heard
clearly, it took me a long time to react. I suddenly pressed the brake
pedal and we were both thrown forward. The examiner looked at me sadly.
'Mr.Eames,' he said, in a mournful voice, 'you have just killed that
child!'

** Lesson 70 Red for danger
How was the drunk removed from the ring?
During a bullfight, a drunk suddenly wandered into the middle of the
ring. The crowd began to shout, but the drunk was unaware of the danger.
The bull was busy with the matador at the time, but it suddenly caught
sight of the drunk who was shouting rude remarks and waving a red cap.
Apparently sensitive to criticism, the bull forgot all about the matador
and charged at the drunk. The crowd suddenly grew quiet. The drunk,
however, seemed quite sure of himself. When the bull got close to him,
he clumsily stepped aside to let it pass. The crowd broke into cheers
and the drunk bowed. By this time, however, three men had come into the
ring and they quickly dragged the drunk to safety. Even the bull seemed
to feel sorry for him, for it looked on sympathetically until the drunk
was out of the way before once more turning its attention to the
matador.

** Lesson 71 A famous clock
Has Big Ben ever gone wrong?
When you visit London, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben,
the famous clock which can be heard all over the world on the B.B.C. If
the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in 1834, the great
clock would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name from Sir
Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the
new Houses of Parliament were being built. It is not only of immense
size, but is extremely accurate as well. Officials from Greenwich
Observatory have the clock checked twice a day. On the B.B.C. you can
hear the clock when it is actually striking because microphones are
connected to the clock tower. Big Ben has rarely gone wrong. Once,
however, it failed to give the correct time. A painter who had been
working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed
it down!

** Lesson 72 A car called bluebird
What mistake was made?
The great racing driver, Sir Malcolm Campbell, was the first man to
drive at over 300 miles per hour. He set up a new world record in
September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah. Bluebird, the car he was
driving, had been specially built for him. It was over 30 feet in length
and had a 2,500-horsepower engine. Although Campbell reached a speed of
over 304 miles per hour, he had great difficulty in controlling the car
because a tyre burst during the first run. After his attempt, Campbell
was disappointed to learn that his average speed had been 299 miles per
hour. However, a few days later, he was told that a mistake had been
made. His average speed had been 301 miles per hour. Since that time,
racing drivers have reached speeds over 600 miles an hour. Following in
his father's footsteps many years later, Sir Malcolm's son, Donald, also
set up a world record. Like his father, he was driving a car called
Bluebird.

** Lesson 73 The record-holder
Did the boy go where he wanted to?
Children who play truant from school are unimaginative. A quiet day's
fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over
again, is usually as far as they get. They have all been put to shame by
a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600 miles. He hitchhiked to
Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep.
When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the
meantime, travelled to Calais. No one noticed the boy as he crept off.
From there, he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry. The driver gave him a few
biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city. The
next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he
hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border. There he
was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local
authorities. He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children
who dream of evading school.

** Lesson 74 Out of the limelight
Why was their disguise 'too perfect'?
An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and a party of famous actors
and actresses got off. Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes, they had
taken special precautions so that no one should recognize them. But as
they soon discovered, disguises can sometimes be too perfect.
'This is a wonderful place for a picnic,' said Gloria Gleam.
'It couldn't be better, Gloria,' Brinksley Meers agreed. 'No newspaper
men, no film fans! Why don't we come more often?'
Meanwhile, two other actors, Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves, had
carried two large food baskets to a shady spot under some trees. When
they had all made themselves comfortable, a stranger appeared. He looked
very angry. 'Now you get out of here, all of you!' he shouted. 'I'm
sheriff here. Do you see that notice? It says "No Camping" -- in case
you can't read!'
'Look, sheriff,' said Rockwall, 'don't be too hard on us. I'm Rockwall
Slinger and this is Merlin Greeves.'
'Oh, is it?' said the sheriff with a sneer. 'Well, I'm Brinksley Meers,
and my other name is Gloria Gleam. Now you get out of here fast!'

** Lesson 75 SOS
How did the woman get help?
When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago, it crashed
in the mountains and its pilot was killed. The only passengers, a young
woman and her two baby daughters, were unhurt. It was the middle of
winter. Snow lay thick on the ground. The woman knew that the nearest
village was miles away. When it grew dark, she turned a suitcase into a
bed and put the children inside it, covering them with all the clothes
she could find. During the night, it got terribly cold. The woman kept
as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case
herself, but it was too small. Early next morning, she heard planes
passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal. Then she had
an idea. She stamped out the letters 'SOS' in the snow. Fortunately, a
pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town. It
was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene to rescue the
survivors of the plane crash.

What was the joke?
'To end our special news bulletin,' said the voice of the television

Macaroni has been grown in this area for over six hundred years. Two of
the leading growers, Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante, tell me
that they have been expecting a splendid crop this year and harvesting
has begun earlier than usual. Here you can see two workers who, between
them, have just finished cutting three cartloads of golden brown
macaroni stalks. The whole village has been working day and night
gathering and threshing this year's crop before the September rains. On
the right, you can see Mrs. Brabante herself. She has been helping her
husband for thirty years now. Mrs. Brabante is talking to the manager of
the local factory where the crop is processed. This last scene shows you

** Lesson 77 A successful operation
Did the doctors find out how the woman died?
The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C. has just had an
operation. The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the
Temple of Thebes. As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken
of the mummy, doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman
died of a rare disease. The only way to do this was to operate. The
operation, which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult
because of the hard resin which covered the skin. The doctors removed a
section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory. They also found
something which the X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of the
god Duamutef. This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed
inside a mummy. The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died.
They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it open,
but fortunately this has not happened. The mummy successfully survived
the operation.

** Lesson 78 The last one?
For how long did the writer give up smoking?
After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health' I
lit a cigarette to calm my nerves. I smoked with concentration and
pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette. For a whole
week I did not smoke at all and during this time, my wife suffered
terribly. I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking: a
bad temper and an enormous appetite. My friends kept on offering me
cigarettes and cigars. They made no effort to hide their amusement
whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket. After seven days
of this I went to a party. Everybody around me was smoking and I felt
extremely uncomfortable. When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a
cigarette, it was more than I could bear. I took one guiltily, lit it
and smoked with satisfaction. My wife was delighted that things had
returned to normal once more. Anyway, as Brian pointed out, it is the
easiest thing in the world to give up smoking. He himself has done it
lots of times!

** Lesson 79 By air
Why did the plane turn back?
I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy. My parents used
to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe in the
holidays. A flight attendant would take charge of me and I never had an
unpleasant experience. I am used to traveling by air and only on one
occasion have I ever felt frightened. After taking off, we were flying
low over the city and slowly gaining height, when the plane suddenly
turned round and flew back to the airport. While we were waiting to
land, a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane
quietly as soon as it had touched down. Everybody on board was worried
and we were curious to find out what had happened. Later we learnt that
there was a very important person on board. The police had been told
that a bomb had been planted on the plane. After we had landed, the
plane was searched thoroughly. Fortunately, nothing was found and five
hours later we were able to take off again.

** Lesson 80 The Crystal Palace
How many people visited the Great Exhibition of 1851?
Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the nineteeth century was the
Crystal Palace, which was built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of
1851. The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the
world, for it was made of iron and glass. It was one of the biggest
buildings of all time and a lot of people from many countries came to
see it. A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various
parts of the world. There was also a great deal of machinery on display.
The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth's steam
hammer. Though in those days, traveling was not as easy as it is today,
steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from
Europe. On arriving in England, they were taken to the Crystal Palace by
train. There were six million visitors in all, and the profits from the
exhibition were used to build museums and colleges. Later, the Crystal
Palace was moved to South London. It remained one of the most famous
buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936.

** Lesson 81 Escape
Why did the prisoner attack the driver?
When he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him
into the bushes. Working rapidly in the darkness, he soon changed into
the dead man's clothes. Now, dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle
over his shoulder, the prisoner marched boldly up and down in front of
the camp. He could hear shouting in the camp itself. Lights were blazing
and men were running here and there: they had just discovered that a
prisoner had escaped. At that moment, a large black car with four
officers inside it, stopped at the camp gates. The officers got out and
the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed. When they
had gone, the driver of the car came towards him. The man obviously
wanted to talk. He was rather elderly with grey hair and clear blue
eyes. The prisoner felt sorry for him, but there was nothing else he
could do. As the man came near, the prisoner knocked him to the ground
with a sharp blow. Then, jumping into the car, he drove off as quickly
as he could.

** Lesson 82 Monster or fish?
What was the monster called?
Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea.
Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen, it is now
known that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are
simply strange fish. Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the
shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea. Some time ago, however, a
peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar. A small fishing boat was
carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.
Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every
effort not to damage it in any way. When it was eventually brought to
shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long. It had a head like a
horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail. The
fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined
by a scientist, is called an oarfish. Such creatures have rarely been
seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.

The former Prime Minister, Mr. Wentworth Lane, was defeated in the
recent elections. He is now retiring from political life and has gone
abroad. My friend, Patrick, has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr.
Lane's Radical Progressive Party. After the elections, Patrick went to
the former Prime Minister's house. When he asked if Mr. Lane lived
there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the
ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad. On the following day, Patrick went to
the house again. The same policeman was just walking slowly past the
entrance, when Patrick asked the same question. Though a little
suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer. The day
after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same
question. This time, the policeman lost his temper. 'I told you
yesterday and the day before yesterday,' he shouted, 'Mr. Lane was
defeated in the elections. He has retired from political life and gone
to live abroad!"
'I know,' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'

Who will be driving the buses next week?
Busmen have decided to go on strike next week. The strike is due to
begin on Tuesday. No one knows how long it will last. The busmen have
stated that the strike will continue until general agreement is reached
about pay and working conditions. Most people believe that the strike
will last for at least a week. Many owners of private cars are going to
offer 'free rides' to people on their way to work. This will relieve
pressure on the trains to some extent. Meanwhile, a number of university
students have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts. All the
students are expert drivers, but before they drive any of the buses,
they will have to pass a special test. The students are going to take
the test in two days' time. Even so, people are going to find it
difficult to get to work. But so far, the public has expressed its
gratitude to the students in letters to the Press. Only one or two
people have objected that the students will drive too fast!

of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the
occasion. All those who have contributed towards the gift will sign
their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster's
home. We shall all remember Mr. Page for his patience and understanding
and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly
to school. A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell
dinner in his honour next Thursday. It is a curious coincidence that the
day before his retirement, Mr. Page will have been teaching for a total
of forty years. After he has retired, he will devote himself to
gardening. For him, this will be an entirely new hobby. But this does
not matter, for, as he has often remarked, one is never too old to

What was the danger?
As the man tried to swing the speedboat round, the steering wheel came
away in his hands. He waved desperately to his companion, who had been
water skiing for the last fifteen minutes. Both men had hardly had time
to realize what was happening when they were thrown violently into the
sea. The speedboat had struck a buoy, but it continued to move very
quickly across the water. Both men had just begun to swim towards the
shore, when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a
circle. It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed. In less
than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away. After it had
passed, they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the
boat would soon return. They had just had enough time to swim out of
danger when the boat again completed a circle. On this occasion,
however, it had slowed down considerably. The petrol had nearly all been
used up. Before long, the noise dropped completely and the boat began to
drift gently across the water.

'At the time the murder was committed, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock
train to London,' said the man.
'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector.
'Of course I do,' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My
employer will confirm that I was there on time.'
'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.
'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.'
'At what time did you arrive at the station?'
'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and waited for the train.'
'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'
'Of course not.'
'I suggest,' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth. I
suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train, but that you caught
the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time. You see, on the
morning of the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It broke
down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'

** Lesson 88 Trapped in a mine
Why is the rescue taking so long?
Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours. If they are not
brought to the surface soon they may lose their lives. However, rescue
operations are proving difficult. If explosives are used, vibrations
will cause the roof of the mine to collapse. Rescue workers are
therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine. They intend to
bring the men up in a special capsule. If there had not been a hard
layer of rock beneath the soil, they would have completed the job in a
few hours. As it is, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they
still have a long way to go. Meanwhile, a microphone, which was lowered

** Lesson 89 A slip of the tongue
Who made the only funny joke that evening and why?
People will do anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one.
When the news got round that a comedy show would be presented at our
local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company, we all rushed to see
it. We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several
hundred people present just before the show began. Unfortunately, the
show was one of the dullest we have ever seen. Those who failed to get
in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should
have appeared did not come. The only funny things we heard that evening
came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme. He was
obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the
microphone. As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing.
We all know what the poor man should have said, but what he actually
said was: 'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company. Good ladies,
evening and gentlemen!"

** Lesson 90 What's for supper?
What kind of fish are they?
Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain, but as the
oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive. So
it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the
divers on North Sea oil rigs. Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently
and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under
water, have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into
them as they work. Now they have had special cages made to protect them
from these monsters. The fish are not sharks or killer whales, but
favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural
sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in length. Three factors have
caused these fish to grow so large: the warm water round the hot oil
pipes under the sea; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by
the crews on the rigs; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil
rigs. As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the
lovely warm water. Who eats who?

** Lesson 91 Three men in a basket
Where was the station's Commanding Officer?
A pilot noticed a balloon which seemed to be making for a Royal Air
Force Station nearby. He informed the station at once, but no one there
was able to explain the mystery. The officer in the control tower was
very angry when he heard the news, because balloons can be a great
danger to aircraft. He said that someone might be spying on the station
and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object. The pilot
managed to circle the balloon for some time. He could make out three men
in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars.
When the balloon was over the station, the pilot saw one of the men
taking photographs. Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend and it
landed near an airfield. The police were called in, but they could not
arrest anyone, for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and
the Commanding Officer of the station! As the Commanding Officer
explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other
half was doing!

** Lesson 92 Asking for trouble
Why did the policeman ask the writer to come to the police station?
It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home. I tried
to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell, but she was fast asleep, so
I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it against the wall, and
began climbing towards the bedroom window. I was almost there when a
sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the windows need cleaning at
this time of the night.' I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder
when I saw a policeman. I immediately regretted answering in the way I
did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'
'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone. 'Excuse my
interrupting you. I hate to interrupt a man when he's busy working, but
would you mind coming with me to the station?'
'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see. I've forgotten my
key.'
'Your what?' he called.
'My key,' I shouted.
Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as
the policeman had started to climb towards me.

** Lesson 93 A noble gift
Where was the Statue of Liberty made?
One of the most famous monuments in the world, the Statue of Liberty,
was presented to the United States of America in the nineteenth century
by the people of France. The great statue, which was designed by the
sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, took ten years to complete. The actual
figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been
especially constructed by Eiffel. Before it could be transported to the
United States, a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be
built. The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York
Harbour. By 1884, a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in
Paris. The following year, it was taken to pieces and sent to America.
By the end of October 1886, the statue had been put together again and
it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi. Ever
since then, the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the
millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make
their homes in America.

** Lesson 94 Future champions
What kind of race do the children compete in?
Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a
very early age. At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles, children
become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can
walk. Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter
the water. It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that
they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool. A game that is very
popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race.
Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water.
The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the
pool. Many pedal their tricycles, but most of them prefer to push or
drag them. Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without
coming up for breath even once. Whether they will ever become future
Olympic champions, only time will tell. Meanwhile, they should encourage
those among us who cannot swim five yards before they are gasping for
air.

** Lesson 95 A fantasy
Why was the Ambassador particularly lucky?
When the Ambassador or Escalopia returned home for lunch, his wife got a
shock. He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state.
'What has happened?' she asked. 'How did your clothes get into such a
mess?'
'A fire extinguisher, my dear,' answered the Ambassador drily.
'University students set the Embassy on fire this morning.'
'Good heavens!' exclaimed his wife. 'And where were you at the time?'
'I was in my office as usual,' answered the Ambassador. 'The fire broke
out in the basement. I went down immediately, of course, and that fool,
Horst, aimed a fire extinguisher at me. He thought I was on fire. I must
definitely get that fellow posted.'
The Ambassador's wife went on asking questions, when she suddenly
noticed a big hole in her husband's hat.
'And how can you explain that?' she asked.
'Oh, that,' said the Ambassador. 'Someone fired a shot through my office
window. Accurate, don't you think? Fortunately, I wasn't wearing it at
the time. If I had been, I would not have been able to get home for
lunch.'

** Lesson 96 The dead return
What happens to the lanterns at the end of the festival?
A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan. This festival is a
cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their
homes and they are welcomed by the living. As they are expected to be
hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them.
Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to
find their way. All night long, people dance and sing. In the early
morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a
river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to
eat it. In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been
hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the
festival is over. Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding
the dead on their return journey to the other world. This is a moving
spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns
drifting away until they can be seen no more.
