* ~ X ~

* X marks the spot\\
 A cliché from the earliest days of newspaper photography where the
scene of the crime would be shown with an X to mark where the deed was
done. It goes back even further in romantic accounts of such things as
pirate treasure maps. The expression was being used jokingly by the
1920s, and now can be found as a formula phrase.
* ~* *Y* *~

* Yellow press - /popular newspapers/\\
 As an early experiment in mass-produced colour-printing to increase
circulation, the /New York World/ produced in 1895 a cartoon in which
the main character was a little girl in a yellow frock. One result of
this was the coinage of the term /yellow press/ to describe popular
sensational newspapers as a whole.
* Young Turk - /young and rebellious or unmanageable member of an
organisation/\\
 The original Young Turks were a reformist political movement in the
Ottoman Empire. It was founded in 1889, brought about constitutional
changes in 1908 after a revolt, was successful in the Balkan Wars of
1912-13, but was dissolved at the end of the First World War when the
Ottoman Empire, having fought in the German cause, was broken up. The
name reflected both the desire to rejuvenate a declining empire and the
youthfulness of its founders (young army officers) and some of its
supporters (students). In modern English use, the implication of
unreliable extremism owes less to the actual Young Turks than to the
old-fashioned English view of Turks as rather hot-headed and violent
people.
