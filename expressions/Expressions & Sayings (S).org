|  There is a powerful Hindu taboo against killing cows or eating beef: the cow is regarded as a symbol of life and a sacred animal. Use of the expression in English implies some scorn, however.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  In the penultimate line of Coleridge's /Rime of the Ancient Mariner/ (1798) the wedding-guest is described as 'a sadder and a wiser man' after hearing the mariner's tale.

|  This is a term from cricket, in use by the middle of the 19th century, describing someone who can be relied on to hold a catch. At an unknown date it was transferred to politics and in recent years has spread to more general use, to mean someone who can be relied on not to make serious errors of judgement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  Taken from nautical terminology: if a boat under sail heads directly into the wind it will be stopped by the backward pressure of the sails against the masts. Sailing 'close to' the direction from which the wind is blowing is therefore risky but makes for more rapid progress than sailing at a more oblique angle.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  ...To sail before the wind is to prosper, to meet with great success, just as a ship sails smoothly and rapidly with a following wind. Similarly, to sail into the wind is to attack or reprimand someone forcefully, or to tackle a task with great vigour and directness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

A salad uses vegetables that are raw, and it is this characteristic that provides the metaphorical sense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  The expression comes from the Bible, where Jesus describes his disciples as 'the salt of the earth [i.e. of mankind]' in /Matthew/, 5: 13. He meant something different, however: salt has preserving and purifying qualities (newborn babies in the east were rubbed with salt to promote health) and so the disciples were being described as the agent by which mortal souls were to be purified and preserved. The modern meaning, though related, is untheological.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  Originally it meant to escape injury to one's body, especially to one's back where one was likely to be beaten. Both /bacon/ and /back/ are related to the same Old Teutonic word, and this is more likely to account for the expression than the burning of heretics or the preservation of meat from hungry dogs during winter in the days before refrigerators, as some have suggested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  Used literally, /saving grace/ is a theological term, for the grace of God that allows sinning humans to reach heaven. This is recorded from the 16th century onwards, but in the 19th, the term started to be used for a redeeming quality in someone, which is felt to compensate for other faults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  This rather dated term comes from the whore 'arranged in ... scarlet colour' and seated on 'a scarlet coloured beast' in St John the Divine's prophetic vision (/Revelation/, 17: 1-5). He was probably referring to pagan Rome, though in later theological controversy the /scarlet woman/ became an abusive epithet for the Roman Catholic Church. In secular vocabulary, she lacks these theological dimensions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  Nothing to do with the Scots. This /scot/ is an old and now obsolete word for a payment and was specially used of a municipal tax and of the bill (or one's share of the bill) for entertainment at an inn. A drink on the house was therefore /scot-free/. The meaning has shifted over the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  In Greek legend these were two redoubtable sea-monsters who lived on opposite sides of the Straits of Messina, which separate Italy and Sicily. Scylla, on the Italian side, was specially associated with a rock on to which she lured sailors who came too close. Charbydis, on the other coast, was a dangerous whirlpool. In avoiding the one, seamen were in danger of destruction by the other. The earliest reference is in Homer's /Odyssey/ (XII).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  A vogue expression meaning 'considerable change', though it is now used so often and unthinkingly that it is in danger of becoming no more than another word for any change. The origin is the song 'Full fathom five' sung by Ariel, a spirit in Shakespeare's /The Tempest/ (I, 2, lines 399-407), describing the drowning of the king.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  Literally a sailor who, like his land-based counterpart the barrack-room lawyer, is disposed to raise awkward points about rights and wrongs, as lawyers are prone to do. In other words, he is an insubordinate nuisance, sometimes even more troublesome by virtue of having right on his side. Now used of both men and women.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  In tailoring, dressmaking, etc., seams are the junctions where the edges of two pieces of material are sewn together. Like a turned-up hem, these are on the inside of a garment and are not seen when it is worn. This /seamy side/ is sometimes rough, usually unsightly and best left unseen. Hence the seamy side of a city, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  'Custom is second nature' wrote Plutarch in the 1st century AD. This had been translated into English by the 14th century, and from this idea that something you habitually do becomes so much a part of you that it is indistinguishable from nature, comes our use of /second nature/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  This expression comes from the long forgotten 1866 play /Flying Scud/ by a prolific Irish-born playwright of the period named Dion Boucicault. One of the characters uses the words as an excuse to get away from a tricky situation. This character, an eccentric and superannuated old jockey, says: "Excuse me Mr Quail, I can't stop; I've got to see a man about a dog." This is the only thing that seems to have survived from the play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  Originally American, associated with the history of slavery. The river was the Mississippi, and 'down' implied the transfer of slaves from north to south: there was a slave-market near the mouth of the river at New Orleans, among others. Such transfers took place either because of increased or seasonal demand in the cotton or sugar-fields of the south, as distinct from the more northerly tobacco-plantations, or because the harsher slave-owners of the deeper-south were not choosy about accepting - and dealing with - troublesome slaves whom northern owners wished to offload, or domestic ones who could be turned into profit.\\                                                                                                                |

| / The story of how Esau sold his birthright (his rights and privileges as the first-born) to his brother Jacob in exchange for 'bread and a pottage [soup] of lentils' is in /Genesis/, chapter 25. The word /mess/ does not appear there, but it is an obsolete word meaning 'dish'; /mess of pottage/ would once have been an everyday phrase. As such, it is found in the heading to chapter 25 of /Genesis/ in the Bibles of 1537 and 1539, and by this route, it became part of the semi-biblical expression that has remained fixed in the language.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  The Earl of Clarendon's history of the Civil War, usually known as his /History of the Rebellion/ (1702-4), states that Royalists captured at Birmingham were killed or taken prisoner and sent to Coventry. This was a Parliamentary stronghold where they could expect no help or even sympathy. Even though this incident occurred in the 1640s and the popular metaphor is not recorded until over a century later, there is general agreement that either the event itself or Clarendon's reference to it is the origin of this expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  The expression refers to the farming practice of threshing corn in order to separate the worthless husks from the good grain. Someone who, figuratively speaking, separates the wheat from the chaff identifies what is worthwhile in an undertaking and discards that which is a waste of time. A similar allusion is used in the Bible. This time the wheat refers to those who belong to Christ and are judged worthy and the chaff to those who have rejected him and have no place in his kingdom. /Luke/ 3:17 reads: 'His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire'.                                                                               |

|  The left foot is the wrong foot. The Romans held that anything to do with the left had evil consequences. The gods guarded your right but evil spirits hovered on your left. The Latin for left is /sinister/, a word that has lost its 'leftness' in English but retains the ancient meaning of foreboding. The Romans lived in such intense dread of the powers of evil that guards were appointed to stand at the doorway to all public places to make sure that the right-foot rule was obeyed.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| / A /score/ is originally a notch cut (scored) into a stick to mark an addition when keeping accounts. It therefore came to mean a bill and to /settle a score/ was simply to pay a debt.

|  The Jewish religion recognised seven heavens of which the highest, the seventh, was the abode of God. The seven heavens of Islam - the seventh being a place of divine light and pure ecstasy - come from this. The division was of Babylonian origin, founded on astronomical theories. Despite this antiquity the expression was not used in its modern secular sense until the 19th century, probably as a result of increased British familiarity with Islam during the period of empire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  The modern use of this phrase, which seems to be originally American, always exists as part of the extended and fixed expression /more ... than you can shake a stick at/, meaning an abundance, plenty.

Another early example is from Davy Crockett's /Tour to the North and Down East/ of 1835: 'This was a temperance house, and there was nothing to treat a friend that was worth shaking a stick at'. A little later, in /A Book of Vagaries/ by James K Paulding of 1868, this appears: 'The roistering barbecue fellow swore he was equal to any man you could shake a stick at'.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  ...Shaking a stick at somebody is a threatening gesture or an act of defiance. So, to say that you have shaken a stick at someone is to suggest that person is a worthy opponent. The sense in the second and third quotations above seem to fit this idea: /nothing worth shaking a stick at/ means 'nothing of value'; /equal to any man you could shake a stick at/ means that the speaker is equal to any man of consequence. In all three examples the sense is of 'plenty'.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  ...Where it comes from is not certain. One idea is that it derives from the counting of farm animals, which one might do by pointing one's stick at each in turn. So having more animals than one can shake one's stick at, or count, would imply a large number. Another suggestion is from battle, in which one might shake a stick at a vanquished enemy. No one really knows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  /Shanks/ is both a surname and an old word for 'legs', so the expression is a jocular punning metaphor for 'on a means of conveyance consisting of one's own legs'. It was originally Scottish, first recorded in the early 16th century and probably older even than that. The USA has retained the earlier form, /Shanks's mare/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  A nautical term for a large anchor used only in an emergency. /Sheet/ may once have been 'shoot' (ready to shoot out in crisis), or it may be the seafaring term for a means of attaching something, i.e. the /sheet anchor/ was not simply a replacement anchor but an emergency one and was therefore always kept ready with its own /sheet/ attached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  To shell something, peas for instance, is to remove the shell, pod or husk. To /shell out/ money is to remove its casing (purse, wallet, etc.) and hand over the contents.

|  The original form of the 18th century term was /shill I, shall I/. It was used as a noun, an adjective and an adverb but it was not until the end of the 18th century that it was used as a verb in the way we use it today. The expression is very evocative of the person who cannot make his mind up.

|  /Shrift/ was the act of hearing a person's confessions and giving them absolution from their sins. Someone due to be executed was given but short shrift as they were considered beyond absolution. The word /shrift/ comes from the verb /shrive/ meaning 'to hear confession'. The past tense of the verb is /shrove/, hence Shrove Tuesday, the day immediately before Lent and a holiday; people went to confession and then made merry before starting the Lenten penances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  In the days when seamen were refused shore-leave in case they deserted, 'wives' were allowed on board a berthed ship and permitted to lie in longer than the men. In the morning the bosun's mates had to check whoever was still asleep and did so by requiring them to /show a leg/ over the side of the hammock. If a leg was hairy, it was presumably male and its owner was ordered to get up and begin work.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  A white feather in the tail of a fighting-cock was held to be a sign of inferior breeding and therefore became a metaphor for lack of fighting spirit.

|  A banality to describe extreme disappointment at an unexpected failure or setback. It suggests several meanings of the word sick, among them ill, diseased or disgusted, and parrots are extremely prone to viruses such as the highly contagious disease psittacosis (parrot fever). In the 1970s and 1980s, it was a somewhat overused metaphor favoured by football managers, who often used it to describe their feelings after losing a match. Despite being mocked by the satirical magazine /Private Eye/, and perhaps helped by the absurdity of the 'Dead Parrot' sketch in /Monty Python's Flying Circus/, its imagery caught the public imagination, and it is now used ironically.                                                                         |

|  At the height of the Temperance Movement in the 19th century, someone wishing to give up strong drink mad a public declaration of resolve by signing a pledge not to touch it again. Though the Temperance Movement long since gave way to Alcoholics Anonymous, it is still possible to hear of people /signing the pledge/. More widely, it may refer to any public declaration of renouncing something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  At one time newspapers did just what their name suggests - they reported the news, informing the population about political debate and decision. When Parliament rose for the months of August and September, /the silly season/, also known in earlier years as /the Big Gooseberry Season/, began. Deprived of Parliament for its steady provision of newsworthy items such as political rows, leaks to the press, errors of judgement and interference in the affairs of other countries, desperate journalists were forced to make much of giant gooseberries, the Loch Ness monster and the like, to keep the paper in print. The silly season still comes round each year but the British public is now fed a year-round diet of trivia and so hardly notices.   |

|  Homer's /Odyssey/ describes the Sirens as malevolent female sea-monsters having the head and bust of a woman and the body of a bird. They sang sweetly to attract men and then destroyed them. Odysseus had been warned about them, so when he came in sight of the rocky islet where they lived he had himself lashed to the mast of his ship, having previously stopped up the ears of his companions with wax so that they could not hear the enchanting music. He therefore escaped the danger, but the bones scattered about the island were proof of the failure of previous voyagers.\\                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  Sisyphus, a cunning hero in Greek legend, died as a result of offending Zeus but fabricated an excuse to return temporarily to earth from the underworld. He then refused to go back, and was punished for his breach of faith by being required eternally to roll a great boulder up a mountain; the boulder slipped down again each time he got it nearly to the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  This widely used phrase comes from the 1940s American radio quiz show, /Take It or Leave It/. During the course of the show contestants were asked increasingly difficult questions for prize money, which also increased as the questions became harder. The final question was worth $64. Inflation has affected this expression over the years since it began life as the humble sixty-four dollar question, growing first to sixty-four thousand and recently to sixty-four billion. The expression is used in all English-speaking countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  A /skeleton at the feast/ is somebody or something that in the midst of pleasures acts as a reminder of life's troubles. The expression alludes to the practice among the ancient Egyptians of displaying a skeleton at a celebration to remind guests of their mortality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  This phrase means a secret personal or family disgrace, problem, discreditable fact or scandal from the past. It has been said to date from the 19th century, when corpses were much sought after for medical research or teaching but were unobtainable legally, with the result that a skeleton would have to be kept hidden. This is unlikely: a skeleton can be copied in other materials. The origin is more probably an old saying or joke comparing a person's secret with a murder they committed and hushed up.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  ...However, an apocryphal story has it that a person without a single care or trouble in the world had to be found. After a long search, a squeaky-clean lady was found, but to the great surprise of all, after she had proved herself on all counts she went upstairs and opened a closet that contained a human skeleton. 'I try and keep my trouble to myself, but every night my husband makes me kiss that skeleton,' she said. She then explained that the skeleton was that of her husband's rival, killed in a duel over her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  This is an American expression for the poorest part of town where vagrants, alcoholics etc. end up. In the timber industry, a skid row is a row of logs down which other logs roll, slide or skid on their way for further processing. Tacoma near Seattle flourished on its timber industry; it also had a plentiful supply of alcohol. Brothels became available for loggers working on the skid row and the dregs of society soon ended up there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It appears in Dickens' /Sketches by Boz/, 3:36 'They lived in the same street, walked to town every morning at the same hour, dined at the same slap-bang every day.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  Unlikely as it may seem, the /top/ referred to here is the child's toy which seems not to be moving when it is spinning, though it wobbles when being set in motion or when running down. It is this period of apparent stillness (accompanied by a quiet and steady sound?) that gave rise to the simile, first used by Shakespeare or his collaborator Fletcher in /Two Noble Kinsmen/ (1613) and common ever since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  Before box springs came into use, old bed frames used ropes pulled tightly between the frame rails to support the mattress. If the ropes became loose, the mattress would sag, making for uncomfortable sleeping. Tightening the ropes would help one get a good night's sleep. Apparently there was a tool - an iron gadget that looked like a clothes peg but larger - which was used to tighten the ropes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  There are two main explanations of this, any of which may be the correct origin. One theory equates /hook/ with a ship's anchor, so that to /sling one's hook/ was to raise the anchor and sail away. The other says the hook is one on which a miner would hang his day clothes. When he finished his shift down the pit, he would change, collect his possessions from his hook, and leave. However, there is an earlier expression, /to sling one's daniel/, which had the same meaning. What a /daniel/ was is unclear, except to suggest that it was some sort of pack.\\                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  /...Hook/ used to be the common short name for a billhook, the heavy curved pruning knife used by farm labourers. This usage of /hook/ could provide the explanation of this expression and its variation take one's hook meaning the same thing, since it could refer to an itinerant worker swinging his hook over his shoulder and moving on to his next job.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  /Slush/ might seem an odd word to use in this sense until it is realised that the original source of such funds was the surplus fat or grease from fried salt pork, the standard food on 19th century ships. The /slush/ was usually sold in port and the money raised used to buy little extras and luxuries for the crew. In 1866, the US Congress applied the term to a contingency fund it had set up from one of its operating budgets. From that time, the expression took its current meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  This dates back to mid-19th century America, most American dictionaries point to it originating from Alec Hoag, a notorious pimp and thief who operated in 1840s New York. He operated a trick called the 'Panel Game', where he would sneak into the homes of his unwary or sleeping clients via gaps in the walls and steal their valuables. He generated such a reputation for not getting caught that he earned the nickname of 'Smart Alec'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  In less hygienic days, when rats were common household and urban pests and carriers of disease, dogs were prized for their ability to smell out and destroy them. A dog that began to sniff around might well have smelt a rat, and this idea was transferred to a person who had cause to feel that something was not as it should be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  This expression is relatively recent in origin, being first coined in the USA by Republican congressman Barber Conable during the Watergate investigation. During the hearing, a tape of a conversation on June 1973 between President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff, H R Haldeman was played: '/Haldeman/: ... the FBI is not under control ... and you think the thing to do is to get them, the FBI, to stop? /Nixon/: Right, fine.'\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  ...Upon hearing the tape, Conable stated that it 'looked like a smoking gun', meaning that from the tape it was evident that Nixon had approved the cover up. Conable may not have been the first to use the phrase, but he was the first to be given credit for using it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The now familiar English formulation emerged only in the late 17th century but earlier approximations to it are common, the earliest being in Chaucer's 'Summoner's Tale', line 1994, in the /Canterbury Tales/ (about 1387), the popularity of which must have been responsible for making the idea generally known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  A whimsical and comfortable comparison dating from the 18th century. The phrase is usually credited to Benjamin Franklin (1706-90), who was very fond of children and wrote these words to Georgina Shipley, the daughter of his friend, the Bishop of St Asaph. As a gift from Philadelphia, Franklin's wife had sent the Shipleys a grey squirrel that they called Skugg, a common name for squirrels at the time. Tragically, he escaped from his cage and was killed by a dog. Franklin wrote this epitaph in 1772: 'Here Skugg lies snug, as a bug in a rug'.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In 1706, Edward Ward (1667-79) wrote in /The Wooden World Dissected/: 'He sits as snug as a bee in a box.'

|  This expression first appears in English in a 1755 translation of the Latin poet Martial's /Epigrams/, but probably owes its own clichéd status to a line in Tennyson's poem on his dead friend, /In Memoriam/ (1850): He seems so near and yet so far.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  This name was coined in the USA in the 1930s because the earliest examples of such serials were sponsored by soap manufacturers in a form of direct financing forbidden in Britain until recently. A specific origin may have been /Amos and Andy/ (1927), sponsored by Proctor and Gamble. The word /opera/ is added derisively: the preoccupations of these programmes are normally well below the level of high drama associated with grand opera. Cowboy films were sometimes called 'horse-operas' at the time of the first /soaps/ - perhaps a little earlier, in which case it is likely that /soap opera/ was a borrowing.                                                                                                                                     |

|  On a piano the soft pedal, operated by the left foot, is used to reduce volume either by causing the hammer to strike only one instead of the usual two or three strings, or by bringing the hammer closer to the strings to lessen the impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  An Americanism, used also as a noun, and familiar in British English since the middle of the 19th century. It is an obvious reference to the lubricant qualities of soft soap but appears to be based on the older 'soft sawder', a variant of the much earlier 'soft solder'. This was a common form of solder made from tin and lead and was used for uniting pieces of metal and, metaphorically, for uniting people. The development of 'solder' into 'sawder' is easily explained because the letter l in 'solder' is often unpronounced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  The first printed comparison between a trifle and a song is found in 1601 in Shakespeare's /All's Well that Ends Well/ (III, 2, line 9) but there is evidence that 'sold for a song' was already proverbial. Sheet-music was very popular and the stationers who printed and sold ballads employed vagabonds to peddle them up and down the country for small sums.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  Early warships had very cramped quarters. Sailors were often forced to sleep between the cannons because that was the only space available. On rare occasions women were allowed on board, some ships actually carried prostitutes. Other times, a sailor's wife would be allowed on board so that he would not have to leave the ship, and potentially desert. In either case, many children were conceived between the cannons. Women who gave birth aboard ship typically also did so between the guns. The male children were thus called /son of a gun/.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  The wild oat looks like the cultivated one but is actually merely a tall grass: to spend time and energy sowing it is therefore unprofitable. The expression sometimes implies sexual activity, probably as a result of the (implied) obsolete sense of 'seed' (semen).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  Now used in jocular reference to any severe cross-examination, this was an infamous ecclesiastical court of the Roman Catholic Church in Spain from 1479-1834. Like Inquisitions elsewhere it was intended to prosecute heretics, was held in secret, used torture as a means of extracting evidence, and had the power to refer its findings to the secular authorities, which usually resulted in the victim's execution by burning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  There are two famous sphinxes. One is the colossal statue (c. 2620 BC) of a lion with a human head near the El-Gizeh pyramids in Egypt. The other is the monster of Greek mythology with the head and shoulders of a woman, the body of several animals and the wings of a bird, who killed those who failed to answer its riddle: 'What animal has four feet, then two, then three, but only one voice?' Oedipus answered correctly: man, who crawls as a child, then walks, then uses a stick for support in old age. Deprived of its secret, the Sphinx killed itself, and Oedipus thus saved the citizens of Thebes from its terror.\\                                                                                                                             |
|  ...It is the sphinx of legend that has given rise to modern uses of the word: an inscrutable person is /sphinx-like/ in being mysterious, enigmatic and incomprehensible - something of a riddle, in fact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  /Spick/ exists nowhere else in English, nor does /span/ as an adjective. It was only in the mid 19th century that /spick and span/ came to mean 'tidy, clean and orderly'. The oldest form seems to have been /spann-nyr/, which is Old Norse for a fresh chip of wood, one just carved from timber by the woodman's axe, so the very epitome of something new. (/Nyr/ is our modern /new/, while /spann/ is a chip, the source of our /spoon/, an implement that was originally always made from wood.) By about 1300, the Old Norse phrase had started to appear in English in the form /span-new/, a form that lasted into the 19th century.\\                                                                                                                      |
|  ...This evolved by the 16th century into an abbreviated form similar to the modern one: /spick and span new/, still with the old sense of something so new as to be pristine and unused. /Spick/ here is a nail or spike. This form seems to have been inspired by a Dutch expression, /spiksplinternieuw/, which referred to a ship that was freshly built, so with all-new nails and timber. It is first found in Sir Thomas North's translation of /Plutarch's Lives/ in 1579, 'They were all in goodly gilt armours, and brave purple cassocks apon [upon] them, spicke, and spanne newe'.\\                                                                                                                                                                       |

It had also shifted sense to our current one, for something so neat and clean that it looks new and unused. Samuel Pepys is the first recorded user, in his diary for 15 November 1665: 'My Lady Batten walking through the dirty lane with new spicke and span white shoes'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  An Americanism that may come from /bean/ as US slang for 'head' (spill or let slip what is in one's head). More likely it comes from know one's beans (know what's what); this is clearly related to the early 17th century English saying know how many beans make five, which has the same meaning. It is a short step from knowing one's beans to spilling them, i.e. telling what one knows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  This is an American idiom that was first applied in political commentary in the mid-1980s under Ronald Reagan's presidency, describing his public-relations advisers during promotion of the 'Star Wars' Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI). These so-called /spin doctors/ were on 'spin control', their mission being to give the preferred interpretation of events to the world's media, thereby manipulating public opinion in the desired direction. The phrase comes from baseball and refers to the spin put on the ball by a pitcher to disguise its true direction or confuse the batter. The /spin doctor/ is now a prominent feature in British politics and business in general.                                                                          |

|  There is a very old expression (c. 1400) 'as like one as if he had been spit out of his mouth' (meaning 'very alike'); Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote much later 'She as like her husband as if she were spit out of his mouth'. Later variants were 'he's the very spit of...' and 'he's the spit and image of...' and this last one developed into the modern version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  In the days when sailors had a rum ration, the order to /splice the main brace/ (two words) meant serving an additional tot as a pick-me-up after special exertion. After the introduction of steamships had made the sailor's lot less exhausting, the order was given when any special celebration was due.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  ...In naval parlance, a brace is a rope and splicing it is a form of repair. The main brace was connected to the main sail; splicing it was not only obviously important but also dangerous in a storm. But there is no very clear link, except a jocular one, between an (unwelcome?) order to do this work and a welcome one to serve extra drink.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  ...'Ship' was the dialect pronunciation of 'sheep' over much of England, and non-countryfolk obviously assumed that the expression referred to a ship, the assumption being reinforced by the reference to tar, which was widely used on wooden ships to coat and preserve the timbers. To complete this transformation of a rustic expression into a nautical-sounding one, the rather extravagant and unconvincing idea of 'losing' an entire ship for the sale of a small economy was changed to 'spoiling' and the now familiar version emerged in the mid-19th century.\\                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It is probable that this image also comes from the application of tar to animals, either for the purpose already described or to mark them out as members of the same flock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  In the days of sail, British warships did not have the best of living conditions. A sailor's breakfast and lunch were sparse meals consisting of little more than bread and water. However, the third meal of the day included meat and was served on a square tray. Eating a substantial meal aboard a ship required a tray to carry it all because of the danger of sudden violent movement and the risk of spillage. Being square, the trays were more easily stacked and stored away when not in use and took up less valuable space than more conventional round ones would.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  /Scratch/ is an old sporting term for a starting-line, probably because it was originally scratched on the ground. To /start from scratch/ is therefore to start from the beginning. To come/be up to scratch (be of the required standard) may have the same origin or be more specifically from prize-fighting: before the modern rules laid down that there should be a certain number of three-minute rounds, a round lasted until one of the contestants was knocked down; there was then a 30-second interval at the end of which he was allowed eight seconds to come unaided /up to scratch/, a line marked in the centre of the ring.                                                                                                                         |

|  In military terminology a /march/ used to be the distance that troops could cover in a day. Any war of movement entails calculations of how far or how quickly an enemy may travel. Gaining a day's advantage, for example using a skilful, daring or rapid manoeuvre to get to a place and be ready for an enemy earlier than he expected, was therefore tantamount to stealing a day (i.e. a /march/) from him. The expression was later applied to other sorts of military advantage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  John Dennis (1657-1734), best remembered as a critic but also an ineffective poet and dramatist, wrote a dismal tragedy called /Appius and Virginia/ (1709) for which he invented a device for making stage thunder. His bitterness at the play's early demise was enhanced when he heard his own thunder-device being used in a subsequent production of someone else's play. The closely-knit and often malicious literary world of Queen Anne's London would have enjoyed his complaint that his thunder had been stolen - and was in greater demand than his play.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  /Sterling/ here is the same word found in /sterling silver/. The term comes from the name of the Norman English silver penny, the purity and reliability of which was recognised throughout Europe. Because of this it came, from the 17th century, to be used as a term of excellence. The word was linked as a set phrase with both /qualities/ and /worth/ in the first part of the 19th century. The origin of the word /sterling/ is uncertain, but it may come from the Old English for 'little star' as many of the coins were decorated with a star design.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| / /Stick in the mud/ is actually a short form of the verbal phrase /to stick in the mud/, meaning 'stick' or 'stay' in an unpleasant or demeaning situation, rather than dragging oneself out of the metaphorical mud. /To stick in the mud/ first appeared around 1620, and was a further development of earlier metaphors such as /to stick in the briers/ (or clay, or mire) meaning simply 'to be in difficult circumstances'. Somewhere around the early 18th century, /stick in the mud/ arose as a contemptuous term for someone who is not only /stuck in the mud/, but actually seems to enjoy being there.                                                                                                                                                    |

|  To /stick one's neck out/, as if inviting the hangman to slip on the noose, is to take a risk. To get it in the neck (be punished or reprimanded) derives from the same idea. If, as has been suggested, both expressions originate in the USA - where a different sort of capital punishment is preferred - the basic idea is more likely to be of rural origin: that of chopping off the head of a chicken with an axe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  This term has been traced back to J.

|  St John's prophetic vision in /Revelation/ includes an account of monsters who 'had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men' (9: 10). The expression acquired its modern metaphorical meaning early in the 16th century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  Originally 'stone-broke'. There are a number of parallel expressions - clean/dead/flat-broke - and perhaps /stone/ suggested itself by analogy with 'stone-deaf' or 'stone-cold', where /stone/ has the force of 'very' (though originally these expressions were compressed similes: deaf as a stone, cold as a stone).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  Stool here is a variant of /stale/ or /stall/, meaning decoy. It appears in Shakespeare in /The Tempest/: 'The trumpery in my house go bring it hither. For stale to catch these thieves'. The word comes from the French /estale/ or /estal/, which meant a pigeon that was used to entice a hawk into a net. The French word probably originally derives from the Germanic /stall/, meaning a place or standing position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  'Excitabat fluctus in simpulo' is a neat little metaphor used by Cicero. Translated it reads, 'He whipped up waves in a ladle.' Some authorities suggest that the storm in a teacup is a variation of this saying. Others have played with the expression, notably the Duke of Ormond's 'storm in a cream-bowl' (1678), Grand Duke Paul of Russia's 'tempest in a glass of water' (c1790) and Lord Thurlow's 'storm in a wash-hand basin' (1830). Storms in teacups do not appear to have arisen until the 19th century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  An alteration, probably as a result of misunderstanding or misspelling, of a section from Christ's Sermon on the Mount: 'Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction ... strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life' (/Matthew/, 7: 13-14). Here 'strait' means 'narrow'; it is archaic in this sense (although it survives as a noun - dire straits, Straits of Gibraltar, etc) and has often changed its spelling to /straight/ (straightjacket, straight-laced), much as purists may object. In fact /straight/ (not crooked) /and narrow/ (strict) makes good sense even though its biblical origin was slightly different.                                                    |

|  ...The very tight fastening of a bodice or corset to which the word refers used to be fashionable, though it was often uncomfortable or even unhealthy.

|  Railing against the Pharisees, Christ described them as 'blind guides, which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel' (/Matthew/, 23: 24). He meant that their obsession with legalistic minutiae was like carefully straining gnats (mosquitoes) from their drink while being oblivious to the fact that they were eating whole camels (unclean meat to the Jews), i.e. they were missing the whole point of religious observance. Later translations of the Bible have 'strain out', which is more accurate than /strain at/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  /Straw polls/ were the forerunners of the public opinion polls that are an ingredient of today's general elections. They originated in America. In 1824 reporters from the /Harrisburg Pennsylvanian/ decided to question the people of Wilmington to try to establish their preferred presidential candidate. The idea caught on. The name /straw poll/ alludes to the custom of throwing a straw up in the air in order to determine the direction and strength of the wind. Figurative reference to this rural practice is much older than the /straw poll/, however. John Selden uses it in /Table-Talk: Libels/ as early as the mid 17th century.                                                                                                                 |

|  The story of Dick Whittington, first published in 1605, refers to a historical figure who was a liberal benefactor and three times Lord Mayor of London in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. Parts of the legend, however, especially the role of the cat that helps its owner to become wealthy, may belong to remoter times or countries. It is now a traditional feature of the story that Dick goes to London, to enter the service of a merchant, because he has been told that it is a place of such great richness that even the streets are paved with gold.

|  This is generally linked to the idea of a shirt on display in a shop window, stuffed to make it look occupied, the idea being of an underlying emptiness. However, the term /stuffed shirt/ is usually linked not just with pomposity, but also with stiffness and formality, and it may be that the image also involves the highly starched formal dress shirts worn at the turn of the century, when this expression was coined in America. These shirts were so stiff down the front that a wearer might well have about as much movement as he would were he stuffed, as well as being typically worn by those with well-stuffed bellies.                                                                                                                          |

|  At first glance this is a curious term because a block is ordinarily thought of as something which bars progress, not merely causes a stumble. The explanation is that /block/ is also an obsolete word for a tree-stump. When William Tyndale translated the New Testament from Greek into English (1526) he was the first to use the term (as one word) in print, as a translation of a Greek word meaning 'cause of stumbling': 'that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way' (/Romans/, 14: 13). The word was retained in the later Authorised Version and has passed into everyday use as a metaphor.\\                                                                                                                          |
|  ...'Stumble at a block' (trip over a tree-stump) is found in a book of about 1450 and was probably everyday English at a time when England was predominantly rural and tree-stumps or roots were far more likely to cause a pedestrian to stumble than they are today. /Stumblingblock/ may also have been current, or may have been coined by Tyndale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  Originally, to stump (up) was to dig up tree-stumps by the roots in order to clear land for cultivation. The expression, an American one from the days of settlement, became figurative with the idea of digging deep into one's pocket to get money out.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  ...The same verb has given rise to stumped. Farmers were said to be /stumped/ if they encountered hidden roots when ploughing land that had been imperfectly /stumped (up)/, i.e. cleared. Consequently, the word came to mean 'nonplussed, puzzled, held up by a difficulty'. There is no good reason for the view that this sense comes from cricket, where being stumped means something quite different (i.e. dismissed).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  Not coined by Charles Darwin, as is usually assumed, but by Herbert Spencer in /Principles of Biology/ (1864-7), though Darwin later acknowledged the appropriateness of the phrase. Spencer used /fittest/ in the sense of 'most suitable'; he was referring to animals' adaptability to an environment. In modern use, however, it is taken to mean 'most strong' and the whole expression is used of people fighting for survival or exercising strength in order to prevail over others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  The belief, which has no foundation in fact, that a swan sings for the only time in its life just before it dies is first recorded in Aesop (6th century BC) and is also found in Latin literature and in English from the 14th century onwards. This song is generally described as melodious, but is variously identified as a dirge and a song of joy at the prospect of death. In Greek mythology, for instance, the swan was sacred to Apollo and Aphrodite and its dying song was one of happiness at the imminence of joining them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| / Fanny Adams was an eight-year-old girl who was raped murdered in Alton, Hampshire in 1867. Her body, cut into pieces, was found in the River Wey. A twenty-one-year-old solicitor's clerk, Frederick Baker, was tried soon after and hanged at Winchester. The adjective /sweet/ was probably added in a popular poem or ballad of the sort that was often composed in the 19th century to memorialise drama or disaster.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

By natural shift, the expression transferred from mutton to monotony of diet and then to any lack of a popular or necessary item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  Popularised by Matthew Arnold, for whom 'sweetness and light' were among the gifts of culture (/Culture and Anarchy/, 1869), though Swift had earlier referred to the same pair, calling them 'the two noblest of things' which the ancient writers had given to mankind (/Battle of the Books/, 1697). The modern use of the quotation is merely jocular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  Originally 20th century military slang. Despite what some authorities say, it is unlikely to be nautical; it is true that a rope weighted with lead was used to measure the depth of sea beneath a ship, but this involved no swinging and was so crucial - and so closely supervised - that it cannot have become a metaphor for malingering.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  ...There was, however, a nautical expression 'swing the leg', an allusion to the pretence of having a damaged leg so as to avoid work: malingerers 'swing' it when walking so as to appear crippled. This expression may have been misheard or misunderstood during its transference to more general military vocabulary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  A catchphrase originating in fairground language, the full expression is what you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts. It is an optimistic assertion that, all things considered, matters tend to turn out satisfactorily if you take the rough with the smooth. Swings go up and down, and roundabouts go round and round, but taken both together they add up to the same thing - a way of giving amusement and making a living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  The sword of Damocles was, according to the Roman orator and philosopher Cicero, a sword hung from the ceiling by a single hair. It was so placed at a banquet above the head of the sycophantic courtier Damocles by Dionysius the Elder, ruler of Syracuse from 404 to 367 BC, to remind Damocles of the precariousness of the power and privilege which he envied. It is still a popular metaphor for any great and threatening evil that may befall one at any time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
