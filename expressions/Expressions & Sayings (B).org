|  This is an Australian expression, 19th century in origin, which is now commonly used to describe any remote area, but which originally referred to the vast spaces of the interior of the country, the Great Outback. The /back/, reduced from /back country/, is the outlying territory beyond the settled regions. The term /backblock/ is found in 1850, referring to those territories of Australia split up by the government into blocks for settlement. The more isolated and sparsely populated areas of the Australian interior are also known as the /bush/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  This infamous phrase, meaning to go back to the ground rules, to 'traditional values', was first heard in politics in the 1950s. It probably derived from the expression, used in mathematics and physics, /to go back to first principles/, with its implication that any calculation, however complicated, has its origin in just a few essential basic rules. /Back to basics/ was taken up by the British Conservative Party in 1993 as an all-embracing political slogan designed to promote family values. John Major, the Prime Minister, launched this ill-fated phrase, albeit with the best of intentions, in a speech to the Conservative Party Conference in 1993: 'The message from this conference is clear and simple. We must go back to basics.

|  ...While it may be true that commentators used the phrase 'back to square one', it would not have meant what it now means: soccer is a game of rapid movement and there is little sense of starting again after useless effort. There is, however, an alternative origin in board games such as Snakes and Ladders in which certain throws of the dice do indeed take the players back to square one, wiping out the progress they have made. This is the more likely origin of the phrase, though football commentators may have popularised it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  From badger-baiting. Because of their fierceness in defending their burrows against attack, captured badgers were formerly used in sport: a badger was placed in an artificial burrow, such as a kennel made out of a tub, and dogs were set on it in turn to see which could draw it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Bakers, it is said, used to add an extra loaf to every batch of twelve to make sure that they stayed on the right side of the law.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  ...This explanation overlooks the problem that few people were ever likely to buy that sort of quantity. A better explanation, dating from 1419, is that dealers and street vendors were given thirteen loaves for the price of twelve, this being an arrangement with the baker to regulate the extent of the middleman's profit or commission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  This is not a reference to the male anatomy, as some would believe, but an expression from the world of aviation. On an aeroplane, the handles controlling the throttle and fuel mixture are often topped with ball-shaped grips, referred to by pilots as (naturally) /balls/. Pushing the balls forward, towards the /wall/ of the cockpit, is to apply full throttle and the highest possible speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The hoisting of balloons was often, for the infantry, a sign that a major attack was imminent, though nowadays 'What time does the balloon go up?' can simply mean 'What time does it start?'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  /Ballpark/ is the American term for the playing area of a baseball match. The idea behind a /ballpark figure/ is that of a ball being hit within the playing area where it can be seen, as distinct from being hit out of the ballpark - both out of sight and high-scoring.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  The word /bandy/ originates from an Old French word /bander/, which was used in an early form of tennis and meant to 'hit a ball to and fro'. Later, in the early 17th century, /bandy/ became the name of an Irish team game from which hockey evolved. The ball was /bandied/ (hit) back and forth between players. The crooked shape of the stick with which the game was played produced the expression bandy-legged, for someone with bowed legs. It is easy to see how the word /bandy/ came to be associated with arguing in the sense of passing words to and fro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  The first banks were in medieval Venice, then a prosperous centre for world trade. They were no more than benches set up in main squares by men who both changed and lent money. Their benches would be laden with currencies from the different trading countries. The Italian for bench or counter is /banco/ and the English word /bank/ comes from this. Banks have always had a reputation for dependability and from this sense arrives the expression /to bank on/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  Initially this meant the grace of the Holy Spirit imparted by baptism: 'he [Jesus] shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire' (/Matthew,/ 3:11) is one of many biblical metaphors comparing the action of God with that of fire in refining and purifying (especially metals) or destroying.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Finally, it was applied to a soldier's first experience of being under fire in battle. This last sense gave rise to the modern usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  An Americanism first found in print in a book by Davy Crockett, the folk hero and Congressman, in 1833. It comes from the hunting of raccoon, a tree-climbing animal valued for its fur. Being a nocturnal animal it had to be hunted at night, which explains why the hunting dogs responsible for signalling in which tree a raccoon had hidden were prone to error and sometimes barked up (at) the wrong one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  The word has been in English since at least the 14th century but acquired this sense only in the late 19th. The explanation seems to be that the word was given a new lease of life during hostilities between American settlers and Indians, whose tomahawks were called 'war-hatchets' or 'battle-axes'. It then came into metaphorical use from /The Battle Axe/, the name of an American women's rights magazine whose writers and readers were presumed to be belligerent and probably elderly spinsters with nothing better to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  A term originally used in cock-fighting for the sort of contest in which a number of birds were pitted together and left to fight among themselves until only one survived, or for a knockout competition beginning with 16 birds fighting in pairs. Presumably, these variations on the more normal single combat were thought to provide first-rate or 'royal' entertainment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| / Shakespeare invented the phrase but meant something slightly different. Macbeth appears willing to kill the king as long as the murder 'Might be the be-all and the end-all here' (I,7, line 5), i.e. if it could be complete in itself, without any consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  A /bean-feast/ used to be an annual dinner given by an employer to his staff and was so called because beans, or more likely bean-geese (so called from a bean-shaped mark on their beaks), were served.

|  Two distinct ideas are run together here. The first is from the words of the young David explaining why he should be allowed to fight Goliath: when he was a shepherd 'there came a lion ... I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him' (/I Samuel,/ 17: 34-5). The second, which is first found added on in Walter Scott's poem /Marmion/ (1808), is a borrowing from a different story, that of [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsd.htm#Daniel%20in%20the%20lion's%20den][Daniel in the lion's den.]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  From the military /beat retreat/, beat a drum as a signal for retreat. In beat hollow (vanquish completely), 'hollow' is probably a corruption of 'wholly'. In off the beaten track (remotely situated; unusual), 'beaten' is used in its old sense of 'well-trodden', i.e. beaten by feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  /Beat the bush/ dates from about 1300 and is found in the 14th century proverb 'One beats the bush, another takes the bird', meaning that one person works and another, the master, profits. The reference is to hunting for game-birds: the beater disturbs it and the hunter ensnares it as it flies from cover. Nowadays game-birds are more likely to be shot in flight; before the invention of gunpowder more caution was needed to get near the bird before hunting could start. This sense of slow approach attached itself to the metaphorical meaning of the current phrase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  Now a jocular catchphrase for two sharply contrasting people or things, this is originally the title of a fairy-tale introduced into European literature in Straparola's /Pleasant Nights/ (1550-3) and in a better-known French version by Villeneuve in 1740-1. To save the life of her father, his youngest daughter Beauty agrees to live with the Beast, an ugly monster; filled with pity and affection she finally agrees to marry him, whereupon he turns into a handsome prince, released from a cruel spell by her virtue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  The beaver is remarkable for its industry (and skill) in constructing its habitation and creating dams to preserve its water supply.

|  The /call/ part of the phrase is fairly straightforward: if someone in authority calls, one should answer promptly. The /beck/ part is more obscure. /Beck/ is defined as 'a mute signal or significant gesture, especially one indicating assent or notifying a command; e.g., a nod, a motion of the hand or forefinger, etc.'. Although the word /beck/ used outside of /beck and call/ is archaic and rarely heard today, it is only a shortened form of the familiar word /beckon/ meaning 'to make a mute signal or gesture', especially to call a person to you. /Beckon/, in turn, comes from an old Germanic word meaning 'signal' from which we also derive the modern English word /beacon/. As a verb, /beck/ first appeared around 1300AD (/beckon/ is a bit older, first showing up around 950). The phrase /beck and call/ is more recent, dating only to about 1875.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  Because of its beauty, fragrance and colour, the rose figures prominently in literature, often indicating a person - especially a woman - of peerless beauty, virtue and excellence. It is also an emblem of England, a heraldic device and an element in Christian symbolism. Common expressions include /bed of roses/, a position of ease and comfort, and roses all the way (a quotation from Robert Browning's poem /The Patriot/, 1855), which means pleasing or triumphant progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The notion of having a bee in one's bonnet implies an inability to concentrate on anything else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  A more intelligible piece of slang, 'no bigger than a bee's knee', is recorded from the late 18th century onwards. This might, or might not, have been transmogrified into the present expression by the bright young things of the 1920s, when not only language, but music, dancing, dress and social behaviour were frantically valued - in the wake of the First World War - for their breaking of convention. /Bee's knees/, like the equally improbable cat's pyjamas ** and its variant the cat's whiskers - all three mean the same - belongs to that period and has survived because of an engaging idiocy reinforced by rhyme. At about the same time, people played with other phrases that linked animals to humans, and we find the /kipper's knickers/, /the snake's hips/, /the elephant's instep/ and so on. However, in the last few years modern imagination has taken the idea further, and we now have more ribald phrases such as /the dog's bollocks/, which is sometimes abbreviated to just /the dogs/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  Once mainly used to indicate resignation about one's situation, nowadays this is often used more aggressively, of other people's situations, implying 'like it or lump it'. This expression was in use by 1546 when it appeared, in a book of proverbs compiled by John Heywood, in the form 'Folk say always, beggars should be no choosers'. Another proverb 'If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride', approaches the situation from a different angle; but is more rarely used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  This expression dates from the time when geese were commonplace and much used for food, whereas swans were rarer, regarded as more beautiful, and often used in literature as an image of faultlessness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  This expression refers to non-essential but often engaging features added to something to make it seem more attractive without actually enhancing its main function. There is a certain amount of debate as to where it comes from, the use of both these devices on streetcars, steamships and railway locomotives for warning or signalling purposes being variously cited. However, it is more likely that the term comes from the theatre organ. These mighty instruments augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to help the organist accompany silent films, among them car horns, sirens and bird whistles. These effects were called /toys/, and organs often had /toy counters/ with 20 or more noisemakers on them, including bells and whistles. When talkies arrived, theatre organs continued to be used for quite a time, and these fun features must then have been considered no longer essential to the function of the organ, but frivolous add-ons. It is possible that the expression grew out of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  An ancient fable tells of a colony of mice who met together to discuss how they could thwart a cat that was terrorising them. One young mouse suggested hanging a bell around the cat's neck so that its movements would be known to them. This plan delighted the rest of the group until an older and wiser mouse asked the obvious question, "Who will bell the cat?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  This American expression seems to have originated simply as the opposite of the notion of leaning towards or bending over someone in solicitude or friendship. In other words it means making a special effort even if that entails acting against one's inclination and going to the opposite extreme in an attempt to show no bias.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  Sometimes used of formal dress. Originally used only of women's clothes: a bib was a piece of cloth, like the upper part of an apron, worn between throat and waist; a tucker was a frill of lace or muslin covering the neck and shoulders. The phrase dates from the 17th century and has gradually been adopted, originally jocularly, to apply to men's clothes as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  In his poem /To a Mouse,/ subtitled 'On turning her up in her nest with the plough, November 1785', Robert Burns expresses sorrow for destroying the mouse's carefully constructed shelter and muses on the lot of man and animal. It is in this context that these words occur, except that in the original they are in dialect and Burns actually wrote 'schemes' not 'plans'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  Often shortened to /Best of British/, this is an ironic quip as if to say, 'You get on with it, but leave me out.' It was frequently heard during the early days of WWII, when the Allies were losing confidence in their ability to win the war and British luck was hard to come by.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  ...In the 1960s, 'And the best of British' took on a less sarcastic and more positive meaning, especially with the government-supported 'I'm Backing Britain' campaign. The expression also became one of comedian Frankie Howerd's (1917-92) innuendo-laden catchphrases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Scylla was the monster on the cliffs and Charybdis was the dangerous whirlpool. Neither fate was more attractive, as both were difficult to overcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  Here /devil/ is nautical slang for a seam between planks that was difficult to caulk, i.e. make watertight by hammering oakum (fibres of rope) into the gap and then adding tar. The word was particularly used for the long seam of the first plank on the outer hull next to the keel, and for the seam along the edge of the deck where only the thickness of the hull was between this /devil/ and the sea. No doubt awkward and difficult seams were given this name because they were 'the devil' to get at. The whole phrase therefore meant, literally, a physical position between two unpleasant things and, metaphorically, a dilemma.

|  Formerly '... and the bedpost', which made better sense in implying intimacies as of people in bed together. Perhaps as the expression passed round among people who knew nothing of four-poster beds they substituted a sort of post that was more familiar to them. However, 'post' had long been metaphorical for anything deaf, lifeless or ignorant; what matters is not the type of post but the fact that any post can be relied on not to reveal a confidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|  Used to counsel caution when someone previously unsympathetic appears to offer a favour. It is a rough version of a line in Virgil's /Aeneid/ (Bk II, line 49) where Laocoon warns the Trojans not to accept from the Greeks the wooden horse that was to prove their undoing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  A pale used to be an area within certain bounds, subject to a particular jurisdiction. Its name came from a now obsolete sense of pale - a wooden stake used in enclosing an area with a fence. There were English Pales in France in the 15th century (the territory of Calais) and in Ireland, around Dublin, from the Middle Ages until the 16th century. Those beyond the Pale were held to be beyond the limits of civilised jurisdiction. The modern expression, with a small p, retains this colouring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|  The name was first coined in the 1920s by John J Fitzgerald, a reporter for the /Morning Telegraph/, who used it to refer to the city's race tracks and who claimed to have heard it used by black stable hands in New Orleans in 1921. Black jazz musicians in the 1930s took up the name to refer to the city, especially Harlem, as the jazz capital of the world. The epithet was revived in 1971 as part of a publicity campaign by Charles Gillett, in charge of a push to attract tourists to New York, who was possibly inspired by the name of the Beatles' trading company, the Apple Corporation, founded in 1968. The general allusion is to a city that is the /big apple/ sought as the ultimate location for anyone seeking world fame. There are many classical references to apples, such as the golden apples given by Venus to Melanion. The sentiment behind /The Big Apple/, however, is more likely to be the idea of an apple as a symbol of the best, as in the [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayings.htm#Apple%20of%20one's%20eye][apple of one's eye]].\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  Said jocularly, ironically or more seriously of a person or organisation, such as a government, exercising dictatorial control. The allusion is to George Orwell's prophetic novel /1984/ (1949) in which Big Brother is the sinister, despotic and omnipresent figurehead of a ruthlessly repressive and dehumanising Stalinist state that crushes all individuality. 'Big Brother is watching you' is the slogan on huge posters showing his image, displayed everywhere in a manner still characteristic of some totalitarian regimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  This is an Americanism, though it started life in English via Persian and originally had nothing to do with dairy products. The source is the Persian or Hindi word /chiz/, meaning a thing. Sir Henry Yule wrote it up in his famous Anglo-Indian dictionary /Hobson-Jobson/ (1886). He said that the word used to be common among Anglo-Indians and quoted such expressions as 'These cheroots are the real chiz' and 'My new Arab is the real chiz'. In early 19th century London the expression 'the real thing' was already widely used and once returnees from India were heard to use 'the real chiz' it is easy to see how the two merged and the unfamiliar foreign word changed into the more recognisable /cheese/.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  This is a 19th century catchphrase from the world of boxing, a useful sentiment for the underdog. It is often attributed to the boxer 'Ruby' Robert Fitzsimmons (1862-1917), but what he actually said, when faced with a match against James J. Jeffries in 1900, was 'You know the old saying "The bigger they are, the further they have to fall"', so he was not claiming to have invented the expression. The saying was particularly appropriate in this context, for Fitzsimmons, who had already lost his world heavyweight championship to Jeffries the previous year and was to lose to him again, was light enough to have boxed and won the world championship at both middleweight and light-heavyweight, and weighed only 170 pounds. Jeffries, nicknamed 'The Boilermaker' and later known as the [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsg.htm#Great%20white%20hope][Great White Hope]], was 6 foot 2½ tall and weighed 220 pounds. It was a real [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsd.htm#David%20and%20Goliath][David and Goliath]] match, but this time Goliath won. Fitzsimmons was British-born, but spent much of his fighting life in the USA, and the saying still has strong American associations. As a catchphrase, the expression was particularly popular among troops in the First World War.   |

|  The proverb /birds of a feather flock together/, meaning that people of a similar type will be drawn together, has been in use since the 16th century in English, although similar sentiments are found as far back as Homer. The shortened form /birds of a feather/, has only been really popular since the 19th century. /Of a feather/ here means 'of the same species'. The expression is nearly always used disapprovingly, suggesting that it is bad qualities the people have in common. It is still too soon to tell if the highly successful British television comedy of clashing aspirations called /Birds of a Feather/ will significantly affect the way people use the expression, but it can be found used with reference to the series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  An American expression of late 19th century origin. It probably refers to the offering of a bite from a plug of tobacco. A greedy man might naturally bite off as much as he could but then be unable to chew his mouthful comfortably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  Said to refer to the practice of giving soldiers or sailors a bullet to clench between their teeth during amputation or other surgery in the days before anaesthetics. This may have been so, though a piece of wood or cloth would have been equally handy, more suitable for biting and less likely to be swallowed. A better explanation is that soldiers in battle placed bullets between their teeth so that they could reload more quickly; to be ready to 'bite the bullet' was therefore to be ready for battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  This is probably no more than a jocular or blunt description of the act of falling flat on one's face, though it may be derived from 'his enemies shall lick the dust' (Psalm 72: 9), which refers to an act of humiliation or acknowledgement of defeat. The phrase is first found in Smollett's translation of /Gil Blas/ (1749) but the idea of biting the ground (or the sand, in Pope's translation of the /Iliad,/ 1715-20) is quite common before then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  First used in this sense by Edmund Burke (1729-97), the writer, orator, statesman and thinker: 'And having looked to government for bread, on the very first scarcity they will turn and bite the hand that fed them' (/Thoughts and Details on Scarcity/). Previously it meant to commit a blunder: 'He is wonderfully unlucky, insomuch that he will bite the hand that feeds him' (John Addison in /The Spectator/, 1711).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  A jocular simile used of a place that is small, dark, cramped, uncomfortable or dismal. The original was a prison cell of less than 30 square yards in Fort William, Calcutta, into which the Nawab of Bengal crammed 146 European prisoners overnight after he had penetrated the defences under a flag of truce during his capture of the city in 1756. By the following morning, all but 23 of the prisoners had suffocated. This notorious event during the struggle for India was an important factor in the establishment of British rule, as the British saw it as demonstrating the impossibility of civilised coexistence between local rulers and foreign traders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  As its spelling implies, a /ballot/ was originally a small ball, It was used in a secret voting system which involved placing ballots in a box or urn; a black one was used to express an adverse vote, hence the modern meaning.

Today the means of voting may be different, but the term is still in use, as is the exclusivity it represents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  The black sheep may once have been feared because of a superstition that black was the colour of the devil; there was also a proverb to the effect that black sheep bit people. The more likely reason for the disdain, however, is more pragmatic: its fleece could not be dyed and was therefore less valuable than that of its paler siblings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  A /blaze/ is a white patch on the face of a horse or other animal. The word was adopted to signify a prominent white mark made on a tree by chipping off a piece of the bark to indicate a path or trail. Its first recorded use as a verb in this sense is in the /Journals/ (1750) of the American Thomas Walker, who explored land for speculative purposes. It obviously originated in the language of settlers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  This is generally used as /to go out in a blaze of glory/, like a fire giving a final burst of flames before being extinguished. However, this is a fairly recent development, for in the past the expression was used of such things as sunsets. The first recorded use of the phrase, perhaps the source of it, is in the poem /The Hind and the Panther/ (1686) by Dryden, where he writes, 'Thy throne is darkness in the abyss of light, / A blaze of glory that forbids the sight.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  Used of misguided leadership. Originally said by Jesus in reference to the Pharisees, a sect who strictly observed the letter of religious law and claimed superior sanctity: 'They be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch' (/Matthew/, 15: 14).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  In the days when schoolchildren were expected to learn mainly by mechanical practice, repetition and copying from models, a copybook contained specimens of handwriting - often in the form of proverbs and improving maxims - and other material printed with blank spaces which the pupil filled in by careful copying out. Sometimes a copybook without blank spaces was used in conjunction with an exercise book, also called a copybook because it was used for copying out. In either case, to /blot/ (make an ink-blot on) /one's copybook/ was to commit a fault and mar one's record.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  An allusion to a fable by Aesop in which a satyr meets a traveller blowing on his fingers to warm them. Invited home by the satyr, the traveller blows on his soup to cool it. The satyr turns him out, wishing to have nothing to do with someone who can blow hot and cold from the same mouth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  Because of its penetrating sound, the trumpet has been used from ancient times to send signals (especially military ones), express celebration or draw attention to something. The arrival of an important person may even today be proclaimed by a fanfare of trumpets. In contrast, a person who has to blow his own trumpet lacks modesty and invites derision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  /Gaff/ was originally 'gab', a colloquial word (from 'gabble') for too much talking or glib prattling of the kind that may be indiscreet at times. If, as is likely, gab is related to 'gob', slang for 'mouth', we get an idea of 'blowing' the mouth (as one blows an instrument) as a term for letting out too much air, i.e. talking too much or too loudly.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  Blue blood, a direct translation of a Spanish term, was claimed by certain noble Castilian families who were of pure Spanish descent with no dark-skinned Moorish ancestry. Their claim appears to have been based on the blueness of their veins, which were not of course bluer than anyone else's: they merely showed through more clearly against fairer skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  The most desired Order of Knighthood in Britain is the blue ribbon of the Garter. It is conferred by the Sovereign. By extension, the /blue ribbon/ connotes excellence and the highest honour. The phrase usually forms part of a larger one, such as /the Blue Ribbon of the Turf/ (the Derby) or /the Blue Ribbon of the Law/ (the office of the Lord Chancellor). In /the Blue Ribbon of the Atlantic/ only, it has an alternative form, /the Blue Riband of the Atlantic/. This became popular in the first half of the 20th century when great liners such as the /Queen Mary/ and the /United States/ vied with each other to be quickest across the Atlantic. There is no difference in meaning or connotation between /ribbon/ and /riband/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  Although this phrase has a military ring, it is used to describe women of a certain age with conservative tendencies. It is a slightly derogatory description that refers to the colour of the rinse used to conceal grey hair; conveniently, blue is the British Conservative Party colour. The collective term /brigade/ was obviously applied because of the formidable presence these ladies make at political meetings, party conferences and other rallies of the faithful, but the term can be extended to encompass any group of well-groomed, socially active, usually well-off, elderly women.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  Commonly thought to have originated as a catchphrase after A. J. Balfour was promoted, not for the first time, by his uncle Robert (the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury) to be Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1887. This move was widely interpreted as being the result of nepotism. The expression was initially an ironic or bitter comment, to the effect that everything will be all right for you if Bob is your uncle, though it has now lost this shade of meaning. Sometimes it means no more than 'that's that'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  A /bolt from the blue/ (complete surprise) is more fully 'a thunderbolt from a clear blue sky'. A thunderbolt is, in mythology, the destructive weapon wielded by several gods, notably Jove. It gets its name from the primitive superstition that a /bolt/ (i.e. arrow) from the heavens was the destructive agent in a lightning-flash striking an object such as a tree during a thunderstorm. The expression implies that lightning and thunder when the sky is clear and blue would be unexpected.

To have shot one's bolt (to have done everything one can) also derives from archery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  This seems to go back to the 16th century 'cast a bone between', meaning to cause a quarrel between. The image is that of a bone thrown to dogs, causing a squabble between them. The clarifying addition 'of contention' is first recorded in 1711 and has remained attached to 'bone' ever since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  Originally American student slang, from the Bohn of Bohn's Classical Library, a series of translations in wide use as a study aid in the 19th century. Bohn's, a publishing firm owned by Henry Bohn (1796-1884), produced English translations of Greek and Latin classics that were widely used by students cramming for their exams. The expression /to Bohn up/ soon became /to bone up/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  A development from 'the boot is on the wrong leg' (that is a mistake). Literally this referred to an absent-minded oversight, or there may be something in the explanation that a pair of cheap boots used to be made in the same shape, without differentiation between right and left, so that discomfort could sometimes be removed by changing them round. In that case the expression implied a comparison between being in error and being in pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  By extension, /born-again/ is now used of anyone newly converted to some activity or cause, as in /born-again Socialist/. The phrase was originally applied to fundamentalist Christians in the Southern United States and has been in use since at least the 1960s, although the term originates in the New Testament with the story of Christ and Nicodemus (/John/ 3: 3:): 'Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  The allusion could be to the consequences of hurried moments of illicit sexual pleasure on the top of the blankets, whereas legitimate children are more likely to have been conceived in more leisure and with due propriety underneath them. Alternatively, it might refer to the shame of illegitimate births that forced mothers to have their children in secrecy outside the marriage bed rather than in the comfort of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  Few people today are ever going to use the word /bounden/ - an old past participle of the verb 'to bind' - outside this set phrase. A /bounden duty/ is literally one you are kept to by legal or moral ties. The expression dates from the 16th century, and has probably been kept alive by its use in the /Book of Common Prayer/, where the Communion Service has both 'It is very meet, right and our bounden duty, that we should at all times, and in all places, give thanks unto thee O Lord', and 'We beseech thee to accept this our bounden duty and service'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  J. M. Morton's farce /Box and Cox/ (1847), adapted from a French original, centres on two men of this name who are rented the same room, one by night and the other by day, by an opportunist lodging-house keeper. As /Cox and Box/ (1867), it was also a popular operetta with music by Arthur Sullivan, but it is the earlier title that has passed into more general use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  Here /brand/ has nothing to do with the mark of workmanship, but means 'fire-brand, piece of burning wood'. /Brand new/ comes from the smith's trade and so was originally used only of objects made of metal, which were literally fire-new, fresh from the furnace.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  ...Often the expression is used with the addition of /spanking/, as in brand spanking new. Here spanking does not mean to slap, but is used to give extra emphasis or force, as would /extremely/ or /strikingly/. /Spanking/ appears in English in about the mid-17th century, but then implied something that was exceptionally good or especially fine, showy or smart. It may have come from a Danish or Norwegian word /spanke/, to strut. Later on, horses often had the word applied to them, to mean one capable of moving very fast, but particularly in a smart way. Later still, it could mean no more than moving in any kind of conveyance, with no link to horses. The idea behind the modern sense in /brand spanking new/ is not very different from its first use. The whole expression itself is first recorded from the mid-19th century.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  ...The brand name sense of brand, incidentally, is from a somewhat different sense of /brand/ as a verb, meaning 'to mark with an iron hot from the fire'. The first /brands/ in this sense were probably wooden casks of wine marked in this fashion with the vintner's trademark. The practice of /branding/ cows and horses with a rancher's brand comes from the same source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  This is a double quotation: in /The Tempest/, Shakespeare has the naïve Miranda, brought up on an island with only her father for human company, respond to seeing a group of shipwrecked men, who mostly turn out to be corrupt, with the words 'Oh brave new world, / That has such people in it' (/brave/ here meaning 'fine, handsome'). When Aldous Huxley wrote his novel of a future world in which babies were reared in bottles, sex was encouraged, but love and affection, and especially individuality, were taboo, he borrowed Shakespeare's words, and called it /Brave New World/ (1932), and it is from this that we take the phrase for a nightmare society. The irony of both Shakespeare's and Huxley's use is now often missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  A phrase coined by the Roman poet Juvenal to deplore the declining heroism of Romans after the Roman Republic ceased to exist and the Roman Empire began: "Two things only the people anxiously desire - bread and circuses." The government kept the Roman populace happy by distributing free food and staging huge spectacles such as chariot races, gladiators, plays and athletic events. The expression has now become a convenient general term for offerings, such as benefits or entertainments, intended to placate discontent or distract attention from a policy or situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| * Superstition against wishing an actor 'Good luck!' has led to the adoption of this phrase in its place. The popular explanation is that it derives from the 1865 assassination of Abraham Lincoln. John Wilkes Booth, the actor turned assassin, leapt to the stage of Ford's Theatre after the murder, breaking his leg in the process. The logical connection with good luck is none too clear, but such is folklore.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  ...There is no evidence, however, to suggest that this is the true derivation, and since the earliest usage of the phrase dates to the 1920s, there is much to suggest that it is not.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  ...In the theatrical community, it is commonly told that the phrase refers to bending the knee, an old style of bowing. To /break a leg/ was to bow a lot, meaning a successful performance. However, there is no evidence to support this explanation either and the fact that it only dates to the 1920s rules against it.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|  ...It is also possible that the phrase derives from a German expression for good luck, /Hals und Beinbruch/ ('May you break your neck and your leg'), with which the Kaiser's pilots used to wish each other luck during the First World War. However, this too seems unlikely; it is much more likely that the phrase arose from a simple superstition against wishing someone good luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  Not from taking the plunge but from taking a necessary step to draw water from a frozen source, such as a well. The expression is from early rural life, though there is an alternative explanation of /break the ice/ ** in seamanship: it was sometimes necessary to break the ice on rivers, lakes, etc. to make a passage for boats. This practice has given rise to cut no ice (make no impression on a person).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  Brimstone is the obsolete name for sulphur, a noxious substance. In /Genesis/ God rains down 'brimstone and fire' to punish (19: 24). The more familiar pairing of /fire and brimstone/ occurs as a means of torture in /Revelation/, 14: 10. The idea of breathing it probably originates in the same book, where 'fire and smoke and brimstone' issue threateningly from the mouths of warriors' horses (9: 17).\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  ...A person who breathes fire and brimstone is therefore expressing an angry determination to do something furious, but a person who preaches it does so to threaten damnation in hell for his or her hearers' sins: 'the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone' is hell in /Revelation/, 21: 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  This cliché, for [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsb.htm#Bite%20off%20more%20than%20one%20can%20chew][biting off more than you can chew]], developed after the publication of Cornelius Ryan's 1974 book /A Bridge Too Far/, made into a highly successful film in 1977. The book was an account of the Allied operation of 1944, which parachuted troops into Holland to capture eleven bridges needed to secure the approach to Germany. Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Browning is supposed to have protested to Field-Marshall Montgomery at the time that eleven might be 'a bridge too far', but this is probably spurious. The expression rapidly degenerated into a formula phrase, much used in headlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| * This may refer to winning a pig as a prize at a bowling competition or at a fair, where catching a greased pig was a traditional sport; the winner kept it. There may also be a connection with the Dunmow Flitch, a gammon of bacon which could be claimed at Dunmow, Essex, by anyone swearing to have lived for a year and a day without a household quarrel or a desire to be unmarried; a version of this well-known tradition, established in 1111, still continues.

|  Threatened by the army of Assyria in the 7th century BC, King Hezekiak of Jerusalem hoped for help from Egypt. The Assyrians sent him a discouraging message: 'thou trustest in the staff [i.e. walking-stick giving support] of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it: so is Pharaoh King of Egypt to all that trust him' (/Isaiah/, 36:6). Reeds, a variety of cane, grew in profusion in the Jordan valley and were broken off to be used as walking-staffs because of their straight stems, but they were clearly unsuitable for putting much weight on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|  This term derives from the girl scouts. The organisation had a system of points that the girls would accumulate toward advancement. The phrase entered general language from WWII military slang. The colour of uniforms, the army's tendency to have soldiers do things that seemed silly and child-like, and evocation of /brown-nose/ all contributed to the popularity of the phrase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  /Buck/ is slang for the American and Canadian dollars, and possibly derives from deer hunting, the bucks (males) being more valuable than the does (females). As well as being a male deer, hare or rat (among other animals), a high-spirited young man, a young dandy or, in a more derogatory sense, a male Native American or African-American, a /buck/ is also an article placed as a reminder before a player whose turn it is to deal at poker, and it is very likely that the slogan actually originated at the poker table (see also [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsp.htm#Pass%20the%20buck][pass the buck]]), and has nothing to do with dollars. The phrase was made famous by US President Harry S Truman (1884-1972; President 1945-53), who had it hand-written on a sign on his desk at the White House to remind himself and those around him that he alone had the ultimate responsibility for every decision of his administration. The phrase is now generally applied to the boss of any organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|  The original /bucket shops/ were unsavoury American bars where patrons could buy beer in buckets. In 1882, the Chicago Board of Trade prohibited grain transactions of less than 5000 bushels. Illegitimate trading houses continued to deal in smaller lots; larger houses, if they illegally wished to sell small amounts of grain, sent down to the illegal traders for a bucketful. Before gaining its current meaning, the term then came to describe an illegal brokerage house that often cheated its customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|  The earliest recorded use of this expression is by Admiral Fisher, later First Sea Lord, in 1901. It is not known whether he invented it or was merely the first to write down and make public, in disparaging terms, an existing piece of private Civil Service jocularity. Certainly, the Buggins principle was deeply embedded, and perhaps still is, in the higher ranks of the Civil Service and the armed forces.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  The bulldog got its name either from the shape of its head or from its common use in bull-baiting because of its strength and tenacity; its flat muzzle also enable it to breathe without letting go of the bull. It achieved symbolic national status by being represented as the companion of [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsj.htm#John%20Bull][John Bull]]. The identification of the British as 'the bulldog breed' first occurs in 1857 in Charles Kingsley's historical novel /Two Years Ago/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|  In the USA a /bum/ is a vagrant; the /rush/ is his rapid movement as he is ejected from a place where he is unwanted. /Bum/ in this sense appears to be an abbreviation of the German /Bummler/ (loafer), exemplifying the absorption of immigrant languages into American colloquialism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The allusion is to the Victorian children's nursery at teatime, the children having tea, inevitably squabbling over the buns, teacakes, muffins and crumpets. (Two similar expressions relating to the latter two treats are known from the middle of the 19th century: /crumpet-scramble/ and /muffin-worry/; these have not survived.)\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  ...Interestingly, some of the early uses of /bun-fight/ (these days, also often /bunfight/) borrowed the idea of afternoon tea in the nursery but left out the fighting: it could refer to the most decorous of engagements, such as those one was invited to by elderly aunts of the Wodehousian persuasion, at which squabbling over food was inconceivable. Then, as now, a /bun-fight/ could more generally be any occasion at which food was served, it often being a sarcastic term describing rather formal ones for which guests had to dress up.\\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Often this refers to a heated altercation, but one that the describing observer feels is of no importance, rather like the nursery squabble that started the expression off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  Or, more accurately, destroy one's own means of retreat should a venture fail - an occasional practice of some Roman generals to stiffen the resolve of their troops against the possibility of any such failure. Curiously, both expressions are recorded in English no earlier than the last 20 years of the 19th century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|  This little phrase has been in use for many centuries. Originally, it meant 'in order, neatly spaced'. Chaucer writes of 'Two yonge knightes, ligging by and by', meaning 'side by side'. Sometimes it referred to a succession of separate happenings as in this example from Robert of Brunne: 'Whan William ... had taken homage of barons bi and bi', meaning 'one by one'. From here the phrase took on its modern meaning of 'after a while, eventually'.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|  Originally nautical jargon from the days of sailing ships. To steer a course 'by and large' was to keep slightly off the line of the wind when steering into it so that there was less need for constant adjustment to slight changes in its direction and less chance of being [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsb.htm#Be%20taken%20aback][taken aback]]. In general terms the expression implied freedom from special alertness and exactitude, and this is its sense in modern use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|  The modern meaning is different from the original one, which was that only two means were allowed - the /hook/ or billhook, a chopper with a hooked end, used for pruning, and the shepherd's /crook/, a long staff with a bigger hook at the end for catching the back leg of a sheep. The reference is to medieval laws or rights that restricted the gathering of firewood to prevent depredations: one was allowed to cut off, with the /hook/, only those branches that could be pulled down with the /crook/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|  Like [[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/sayingsh.htm#Hocus-pocus][hocus-pocus **]]and abracadabra, jingo was originally a word from conjurers' gibberish when calling for something to appear. It passed into more general use in several emphatic expressions underlining the firmness of a speaker's declaration; /by jingo/ is still sometimes heard as a mild asseveration in this way. It was probably slightly stronger when it was used in a popular British music-hall song during the Baltic crisis of 1877-8: 'We don't want to fight but, by jingo, if we do/We've got the ships, we've got the men, and got the money too .../The Russians shall not have Constantinople'. From this, those who supported the sending of the British fleet into Turkish waters to halt the Russian advance in 1878 were nicknamed /jingoes/. Jingoism was coined at the same time to denote belligerent patriotism or warmongering, as it still does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  /Jove/ is the older Roman name for the god Jupiter, deriving from an alteration of /Jovis pater/, father Jove. Jupiter was the god of the sky, the sovereign deity who had powers over both gods and men. From medieval times, /Jove/ has been used in English as a poetical form of Jupiter. It has also been linked with /Jehovah/, a form of the Hebrew name of God used in some translations of the Bible. /By Jove/, used as a mild oath, dates back to the 16th century. It was originally a way of calling on a higher power without using the blasphemous /by God/.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|  Before aircraft had sophisticated instruments and flight control systems (and even sometimes today), they were often piloted by feel. Skilled pilots can feel the reactions of the aircraft in response to their actions at the controls. Being the largest point of contact between pilot and aircraft, most of the feel or feedback comes through the seat of the pants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  This evocative phrase is biblical but it is also a misquotation. /Job/ 19:20 reads: 'My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.' Job meant that /all/ he had escaped with was the skin of his teeth. Everything else had been taken away from him: his family, his possessions, his friends and his health. The misquotation /by the skin of one's teeth/ leads us into a different interpretation of the phrase from the original: that one has just about escaped, that it was a close run thing. Nevertheless, the misquotation is here to stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
