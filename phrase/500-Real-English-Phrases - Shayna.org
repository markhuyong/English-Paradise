* Welcome to 500+ Real English Phrases!

The goal of this book is to teach you English *phrases* (not just
individual English words) that you can use in many different situations.
The phrases selected for this book are typical expressions used by
native speakers.

Sometimes I have included a small explanation about when to use the
phrase or what exactly it means; also, some phrases are indicated as
especially

“formal” or “informal.”

You can practice listening to and pronouncing the phrases with the

accompanying MP3s, which are organized by page number.
